Notes on the 2008 rebuild.

The templates, css and images for navigation are all inside the wordpress theme for this design which is called mySociety2008

which can be found in (from cvs root):
mysociety/ms/web/wordpress/wp-content/themes/mySociety2008/

images are in the folder called images, these are jsut images for the theme not for the content.

Images for the content are in a folder called contimg which lives at the webserving root. 

mysociety/ms/web/contimg

please keep images for the content in there so that installing a new design doesn't mean having to work out what needs to be kept for the content etc.
