<h2><a name="background"></a>Background</h2>

<p>In 2006 Chris Lightfoot produced a series of time travel contour maps, after
the Department for Transport approached mySociety about experimenting with
novel ways of re-using public sector data. 

<p>If you have not seen this previous work it is important that you now take a <a
href="/2006/travel-time-maps/">read through the original page</a> to see what
we were building on. 

<p>The original maps were very popular online, and the evening standard even
published a large article with a copy of one of the maps which covered greater
London. 

<p>The Department for Transport asked us to show them how this work could be taken
further, and that is what we are showing here today.


<h2><a name="legibility"></a>Improving legibility and clarity</h2>

 
<p>Many of the maps we produced last time were very pretty, but could be somewhat
difficult to interpret. One major task was to read up on how to display such
complex and valuable data in more intellible ways, and the results can be seen
below.

<h2><a name="houseprices"></a>House prices</h2>

<p>Next, it is clearly no good to be told that a location is very convenient for
your work if you can't afford to live there. So we have produced travel maps
that show not just where someone working can live if they want to get to work
swiftly, we can also show what areas they can afford to live in. 

<p>To help with this process we picked a real world case study, an NHS doctor
working at the Maudsley Hospital in Denmark hill, South London. He's thinking
about getting a foot on the property ladder and wants to know where he might be
able to live that would both be a tolerable commute, and which he could afford. 

<p>First, here's a map showing where the Maudsley hospital is. 

<p>Next, we overlay the travel time contours assuming that this Doctor wants to
get to work by 9AM. As the key shows, each band represents 10 minutes extra
travel time, so the red circle in the middle means he could leave the house at
8.50-9 and still get to work on time. The next band out he could leave at
8.40-8.50, and so on. 

<p>Now let's introduce house prices into the equation. Obviously, at first our
doctor wants to see what's available at the bottom end of the market, less than
Â£250,000 (the average first time buyer price).

<h2><a name="cartrain"></a>Car vs. public transport</h2>

<p>Many people these days are looking to move to public transport, due to
reasons varying from congestion, to cost, to environmental impact. But where
can you live if you want to have the chance of getting to work speedily? 

<p>The following maps show the places you can live in Edinburgh, Cardiff and
Birmingham if you want to be on optimal commuting routes for the centres
indicated with the black dots. Click on the maps for larger versions.

<p>Remember, these are not general maps for the whole city, each map is only
useful for the specific target place of work or study marked with the black
dot. Please don't make a mistake and use these to pick your own place of
residence unless you happen to work at the location these maps are centered on!

<h2><a name="traincycle"></a>Public transport vs. cycling</h2>

<p>For some people, the dilemma is not between the car and the train, it is
between the bicycle and everything else. This maps comprehensively shows that
if you live anywhere near the centre of this map, it's best to get on a bike if
commuting speed is your main concern.

<p>This work was funded by the
<a href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/">Department&nbsp;for&nbsp;Transport</a>, who
also made it possible for us to use
<a href="http://www.ordsvy.co.uk/">Ordnance Survey</a> maps and data through
their licence; without this assistance we would have had to pay expensive fees
to use the underlying mapping data or to produce maps with no landmarks, which
would be almost incomprehensible. DfT also gave us access to their
<a href="http://www.naptan.org.uk/">National Public Transport Access Node</a>
database, which records the locations of train and tube stations and bus stops; without this it would have been difficult to produce any maps at all.</p>

<h2><a name="data"></a>The data we used</h2>

<p>Although the journey planning services and software we used were publicly
accessibly, almost none of the other data is available unless you pay for it,
or your work falls under an existing licencing agreement. So while we set out
to demonstrate how easily we could make travel-time maps from public data, very
little of this work could be cheaply reproduced or extended without assistance
from a government department.</p>

<p>That's unfortunate, because it means that innovative work by outsiders in
this area can only go ahead if it's explicitly sponsored by government. If all
the data we've used had been available for free, somebody else might well have
done what we've done years ago, with no cost to the taxpayer. We'd love it if
others extend the work that we've done, but realistically there aren't very
many people in a position to do this cheaply.</p>
