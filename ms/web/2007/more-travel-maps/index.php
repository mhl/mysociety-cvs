<h2><a name="introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>

<p>This is a follow on report from the one we made last year called
<a href="/2006/travel-time-maps/">Travel-time Maps and their Uses</a>

<h2><a name="legibility"></a>Improving legibility</h2>

<p>Discrete vs. continuous contours. Better mapping backgrounds.

<p>Travelling to work by 9am

<h2><a name="houseprices"></a>House prices</h2>

<p>London house price data

<p>When they see these

<p>Please contact us (email addresses at the top of the page) if you have
any questions or comments. If you're interested in this area, please also
sign up to the (fairly low-traffic)
<a href="http://secure.mysociety.org/admin/lists/mailman/listinfo/maps">mySociety maps
mailing list</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="realtime"></a>What next? Further work</h2>

<p>Two places of work (for couples)
<p>Where should I look for work that I can get to easily?
<p>Travel time to nearest hospital

<h2><a name="acknowledgments"></a>Acknowledgments</h2>

<p>This work was funded by the
<a href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/">Department&nbsp;for&nbsp;Transport</a>, who
also made it possible for us to use
<a href="http://www.ordsvy.co.uk/">Ordnance Survey</a> maps and data through
their licence; without this assistance we would have had to pay expensive fees
to use the underlying mapping data or to produce maps with no landmarks, which
would be almost incomprehensible. DfT also gave us access to their
<a href="http://www.naptan.org.uk/">National Public Transport Access Node</a>
database, which records the locations of train and tube stations and bus stops; without this it would have been difficult to produce any maps at all.</p>

<h2><a name="data"></a>The data we used</h2>

<p>Although the journey planning services and software we used were publicly
accessibly, almost none of the other data is available unless you pay for it,
or your work falls under an existing licencing agreement. So while we set out
to demonstrate how easily we could make travel-time maps from public data, very
little of this work could be cheaply reproduced or extended without assistance
from a government department.</p>

<p>That's unfortunate, because it means that innovative work by outsiders in
this area can only go ahead if it's explicitly sponsored by government. If all
the data we've used had been available for free, somebody else might well have
done what we've done years ago, with no cost to the taxpayer. We'd love it if
others extend the work that we've done, but realistically there aren't very
many people in a position to do this cheaply.</p>
