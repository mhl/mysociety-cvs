What early bugs / scalingy things were there in Dec/Jan?

petsignupd - bundling database transactions
    - although we stopped doing that later?

petemaild - email sending without the writes to disk
    - find lots of problems

PHP FastCGI scripts, perl FastCGI scripts for more loaded parts.

Reverse proxy - Squid

pound - load balancer

Had to hack libapache-mod-rpaf so it works with pound and squid

Reloading PostgreSQL 7.4 database to reduce size (yeuch)
In some ways don't recommend PostgreSQL, in others do.
Tested PostgreSQL 8.0 but had some query/index performance problem.

Was migrating from other servers to dedicated ones far too late.

Adding RAM

Adding indices we'd forgotten

When on news at 10, load balancer maxed out (XXX get details from Pete) - was
    better off with only one frontend server, it turned out

Get some shots of front pages of mail etc, footage from news at 10 etc.

Lots of gaffer tape, spent ages undoing it all.

Mass email send
    - we just had a PHP cron job and exim, which really couldn't handle it
    ("I can let them trickle out in 10 days")
    - 
    - power, the whole rack died

Get lots of web stats
    150 signatures in a second

Mention all open source

Mention that we're hiring

Adding more RAM :)

Future - removing old records (waht is situation with that?)
