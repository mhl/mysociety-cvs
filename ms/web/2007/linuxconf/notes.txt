Put your hands up if you're from a democracy
Put them down if you don't know who your MP is


Intro
=====

govtrack.us


Petitions
=========

Talk about politics of it
- why and that I was initially sceptical it would benefit people
  (i.e. it's just like a letter to a minister, really)


Hardware
========

Two frontend machines
One backend database machine
Linux


Open source
===========

Mention all open source
- which is astonishing for a prominent, government website
- Affero GPL (check and mention status of version 3)
- (get in propaganda about personal worries about SaS ruining GPL)
- people spotted faults in code


Frontend
========

PHP FastCGI scripts, perl FastCGI scripts for more loaded parts.
Reverse proxy - Squid
Had to hack libapache-mod-rpaf so it works with pound and squid
Memory use of processes cannot be done fully from user space (in a stock
kernel).


Backend
=======

Chris's description of architecture
http://www.mysociety.org/2006/12/08/under-the-bonnet/

petsignupd - bundling database transactions
petemaild - email sending without the writes to disk
    - find lots of problems



Early things
============

What we did in first 48 hours
http://www.mysociety.org/2006/11/17/this-is-what-beta-means-the-first-48-hours-of-petitions/

Mention test scripts
    Iterative delivery
    Usability improvements

Adding indices we'd forgotten
Adding RAM

Had to turn off updating of petition counts, and do it in a cron job


PostgreSQL 7.4
==============

Reloading PostgreSQL 7.4 database to reduce size (yeuch)
Dumping it and reloading it was must thorough and reliable way to vacuum it

In some ways don't recommend PostgreSQL, in others do.
Tested PostgreSQL 8.0 but had some query/index performance problem.


Petitions - maybe they do matter
================================

- why petitions can help after all (what stories do we have of changed
  policies?)
- nobody realised you got on the 10 o'clock news if you got a million signatures.


Get some shots of front pages of mail etc
Get lots of web stats
    150 signatures in a second


Load balancing
==============

pound - load balancer - turned out wasn't needed.

When on news at 10, load balancer maxed out (XXX get details from Pete) - was
    better off with only one frontend server, it turned out


Future
======

Mention that we're hiring
Mention that we have lots of volunteers


Finish
======

PledgeBank (as multinational)




Was migrating from other servers to dedicated ones far too late.

Lots of gaffer tape, spent ages undoing it all.

Mass email send
    - we just had a PHP cron job and exim, which really couldn't handle it
    ("I can let them trickle out in 10 days")
    - power, the whole rack died

Mention Chris's death in the middle

Get footage from news at 10 etc.

Future - removing old records (what is situation with that?)

Maybe get annoyed about lack of certified laptops
    - even though I have Matthew Garrett living next door
