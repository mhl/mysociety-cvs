Normally I wear a suit while I'm hacking away
But I thought I'd be casual today, to blend in

I'm passionate about democracy.

<!-- Not used:
NFI:
Moved compass on top of map
Image upload bug (a user helped upload repeatedly when we couldn't replicate it)

Pet:
When we originally specced, could have gone for a 150 signers/second, but went for lower spec of 30/second
In the event it did happen, so system had to be scaled up, but better to start small and scale up

Things to make it work

a) Test frameworks
b) Releasing to smaller audiences first

Other advantages:

a) So that if you're wrong you find out early
        Build only the strategic features that you need
        Best way to use tax payers money

        - One address per council Street repairs vs. environmental

b) It's more fun and easier
    See your work used much quicker
    AND you get the satisfaction of high quality
    Needs good staff
    Get motivated programmers in house
    Be positive, open, encouraging, enthusiastic
    Don't let legalism and bureacracy grind out ideas

    Enpower your developers to make changes
    Make them do customer support themselves
     - they'll soon fix everything!
