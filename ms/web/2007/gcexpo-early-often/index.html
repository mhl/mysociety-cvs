I'm a computer programmer.
Normally I wear a suit while I'm hacking away
But I thought I'd be casual today, to blend in

I'm passionate about democracy.

We think you should release software and websites early, and release it often

Launch early a robust version which has a minimal but useful set of features
Watch your customers, encourage feedback from them
Improve the site
Iterate frequently - we often deploy fixes 5 minutes after being told about the problem

Users help you improve the service though real world use


As examples of this going to give one grant funded, one commercial



National website which collects problem reports and sends them to appropriate local council.

1. Users will never be what you expect them to be like
    Tiny usability details really matter
    Adds up to as big an impact

a) Emails to councils improved (gvt is a user too!) - requested by 2 councils
        - Moved link to higher up email so more visible
        - Added street address of nearest place to pin

<h1 class="incremental">Public sector example</h1>
<ul>
<li class="incremental">High profile public sector project
<li class="incremental">Over 3 million users taking action
<li class="incremental">Just over six months old
<!--<li>10,000 live petitions
<li>4,300,000 signatures by 3,200,000 unique emails-->
</ul>

Petitions:
    48 hours after launch
    * Changes made to cope with expats and overseas military personnel.
    * New options added to sort the list of all petitions in different ways, by number of signatures being the most asked for.
    * Added facility to search petitions

<a href="http://www.mysociety.org/2006/11/17/this-is-what-beta-means-the-first-48-hours-of-petitions/">A dozen other similar changes</a>
    this to a very high profile website

    we could do this because we explicitly said it was a "beta"
    users loved it


Mentions mySociety in sales way at end:
Can have locally branded version
Talking with 2 local councils to trial

You've got the most exciting job at the most exciting time.

<!-- Not used:
NFI:
Moved compass on top of map
Image upload bug (a user helped upload repeatedly when we couldn't replicate it)

Pet:
When we originally specced, could have gone for a 150 signers/second, but went for lower spec of 30/second
In the event it did happen, so system had to be scaled up, but better to start small and scale up

test frameworks?
Releasing to smaller audiences as well

b) So that if you're wrong you find out early
        Build only the strategic features that you need
        Best way to use tax payers money

        - One address per council Street repairs vs. environmental

It's more fun and easier
    See your work used much quicker
    AND you get the satisfaction of high quality
    Needs good staff
    Get motivated programmers in house
    Be positive, open, encouraging, enthusiastic
    Don't let legalism and bureacracy grind out ideas

    Enpower your developers to make changes
    Make them do customer support themselves
     - they'll soon fix everything!
