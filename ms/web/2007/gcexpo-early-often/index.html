I'm a computer programmer.
Normally I wear a suit while I'm hacking away
But I thought I'd be casual today, to blend in

I'm passionate about democracy.

<h1>Release early, Release often</h1>
<p>We think you should release software and websites early, and release them often

<div class="slide cover">
<h1>Release early, Release often</h1>
<ol>
<li class="incremental">Launch early a robust version which has a minimal but useful set of features
<li class="incremental">Watch your customers, encourage feedback from them
<li class="incremental">Improve the site
<li class="incremental">Iterate frequently - <!--we often deploy fixes--> five minutes! <!--after being told about the problem-->
</ol>

<p class="incremental">Users help you improve the service though real world use

<!-- As examples of this going to give one grant funded, one commercial
National website which collects problem reports and sends them to appropriate local council. -->

Look forward to questions
I'll be around aftewards, as will my colleague Etienne
Happy to talk in more detail about lessons
Provide branded versions of our services for local councils
or other services and advice, we'd be happy to talk about as well

Internet imporant, and has the potential to be a huge benefit to large number of people.
You've got the most exciting job at the most exciting time.
Enjoy it.

<!-- Not used:
NFI:
Moved compass on top of map
Image upload bug (a user helped upload repeatedly when we couldn't replicate it)

Pet:
When we originally specced, could have gone for a 150 signers/second, but went for lower spec of 30/second
In the event it did happen, so system had to be scaled up, but better to start small and scale up

test frameworks?
Releasing to smaller audiences as well

b) So that if you're wrong you find out early
        Build only the strategic features that you need
        Best way to use tax payers money

        - One address per council Street repairs vs. environmental

It's more fun and easier
    See your work used much quicker
    AND you get the satisfaction of high quality
    Needs good staff
    Get motivated programmers in house
    Be positive, open, encouraging, enthusiastic
    Don't let legalism and bureacracy grind out ideas

    Enpower your developers to make changes
    Make them do customer support themselves
     - they'll soon fix everything!
