<div class="slide">
<h1>mySociety</h1>
<ul>
<li>Founded in September 2003, with two missions:
<ul>
<li>To be a charitable project which builds websites that give people simple, tangible benefits in the civic and community aspects of their lives. 
<li>To teach the public and voluntary sectors, through demonstration, how to most efficiently use the internet to improve lives.
</ul>
</li>
<li>A mixture of paid people and volunteers
<li>Initial funding from the <acronym title="Office of the Deputy Prime Minister">ODPM</acronym> (<acronym title="Rest In Peace">RIP</acronym>)
<li>As much code as possible released as Open Source; all servers and programming are Open Source
</ul>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>WriteToThem</h1>
<ul>
<li>Successor to FaxYourMP.com
<li>(Nearly) all levels of elected representatives from councillors to MEPs &ndash; simply enter your postcode and send your message
<li>Over 36,000 messages sent so far this year, compared with a total of 42,515 last year
<li>Recently added the House of Lords, to contact your unelected representatives too
<li>Perl and PHP, with a dash of C; our user support is RT combined with RTFM
</ul>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>HearFromYourMP</h1>
<img align="right" src="shoupsm.png" alt="">
<ul>
<li>The flip-side to WriteToThem
<li>People sign up on the site (again, by postcode), and MPs can choose to post messages for them
<li>Responses can be private, via WriteToThem, or public underneath the message
<li>Drip, drip, drip
</ul>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>TheyWorkForYou</h1>
<img align="right" src="hansard.jpeg" alt="">
<ul>
<li>Set up by volunteers and launched at NotCon in June 2004; recently brought under the mySociety wing
<li>Daily updated (when Parliament is in session) from parliament.uk by a Python scraper and parser
<li>Changes at their end can prove&hellip; frustrating, but some things make it all worthwhile
<li>Runs on its own FreeBSD server, with Xapian as its search engine, a PHP front-end and various bits of Perl and Python behind the scenes.
</ul>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>TheyWorkForYou (2)</h1>
<ul>
<li>Currently working on an API, so everyone can access our data
<li>My favourite thing so far, the <em>Hansard prettifier</em>. Should you find yourself on the official site, a simple click on this bookmarklet and you&rsquo;ll be taken to the equivalent page on TheyWorkForYou, if it can be done:
<br><img alt="Official Hansard on parliament.uk" hspace="5" align="middle" src="hansard_before.png"> &rarr; <img align="middle" src="hansard_after.png" hspace="5" alt="The same page on TheyWorkForYou">
<li>We were blamed by Jack Straw this Thursday for an increase in Written Questions by MPs &ndash; more on that later
</ul>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>PledgeBank</h1>
<ul>
<li>A site to overcome the collective action dilemma
<li>Or in English, <em>I&rsquo;ll do something, but only if N other people will as well</em>
<li>PDF posters with <a href="http://www.reportlab.org/">ReportLab</a>&rsquo;s open source PDF Toolkit</li>
<li>Translations with GNU&rsquo;s <kbd>gettext</kbd>
<li>Date parsing with my <kbd>datetime_parse_local_date()</kbd> &ndash; we&rsquo;ve accepted things including: 
<ul>
<li>22nd June 2006
<li>september 30th
<li>7/1/2006 (twice, once by an American, once by a Brit)
<li>31 августа 2006

<h1>Maps &ndash; very un-OS</h1>
<img align="right" src="rail-differences-cambridge-500px.png" alt="Map of the UK, showing difference in journey times by car or train from Edinburgh">

<h1>Maps &ndash; Helmert Transform</h1>
<p>Maps are complicated things. Take railway station locations, for example.</p>
<h2>Cheltenham</h2>
<p class="map"><img src="rail_chelt.png" alt="Map of Cheltenham, with an area to the left and up a bit from the station marked with a red circle"></p>
</div>
<div class="slide map">
<h1>Maps &ndash; Helmert Transform</h1>
<h2>Manchester</h2>
<p class="map"><img src="rail_man.png" alt="Map of Manchester, with an area to the left and up a bit from the station marked with a red circle"></p>

<div class="slide map">
<h1>Maps &ndash; Helmert Transform</h1>
<h2>Or Wolverhampton&hellip;</h2>
<p class="map"><img src="rail_wolv.png" alt="Map of Wolverhampton, with an area to the left and up a bit from the station marked with a red circle"></p>
</div>
<div class="slide">
<h1>Maps &ndash; Helmert Transform</h1>
<ul>
<li>Multimap&rsquo;s red-circle programmer understood co-ordinate transforms
<li>Multimap&rsquo;s data entry people did not
<li>Railway stations&rsquo; co-ordinates miss out the reverse Helmert Transformation
<li>Our <kbd>Geo::HelmertTransform</kbd> should be of use to everyone.
</ul>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>The Future</h1>
<ul>
<li>Usability improvements, using the world&rsquo;s most honest web bug
