    Poking the Beast

    Francis Irving, from charity mySociety, will explain how the new
    computer technology that we all have lets small groups of volunteer
    programmers and usability experts build tools which everyone
    can use to change politics and society.

    Francis will introduce websites such as TheyWorkForYou.com,
    WriteToThem.com, HearFromYourMP.com and PledgeBank.com. He will give
    examples of how they have been used for change in the real world,
    including in Wales, and how they have led some MPs to cheat the new
    system.

    These websites make extensive new uses of old data from lots of
    different sources. Francis will explain the joys of dealing with
    Government copyright, and when to ask forgiveness not permission.

    And finally a call to action, how can you help make it easier for
    individuals to understand what is happening in the Welsh Assembly,
    and lobby it more effectively?
