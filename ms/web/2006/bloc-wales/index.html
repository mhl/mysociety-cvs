MPs cheat by

    - writing themselves letters

    Poking the Beast

    Francis Irving, from charity mySociety, will explain how the new
    computer technology that we all have lets small groups of volunteer
    programmers and usability experts build tools which everyone
    can use to change politics and society.

    Francis will introduce websites such as TheyWorkForYou.com,
    WriteToThem.com, HearFromYourMP.com and PledgeBank.com. He will give
    examples of how they have been used for change in the real world,
    including in Wales, and how they have led some MPs to cheat the new
    system.

    These websites make extensive new uses of old data from lots of
    different sources. Francis will explain the joys of dealing with
    Government copyright, and when to ask forgiveness not permission.

    And finally a call to action, how can you help make it easier for
    individuals to understand what is happening in the Welsh Assembly,
    and lobby it more effectively?

<h1>mySociety</h1>
<ul>
<li>Founded in September 2003, with two missions:
<ul>

<li>To teach the public and voluntary sectors, through demonstration, how to most efficiently use the internet to improve lives.
</ul>
</li>
<li>A mixture of paid people and volunteers
<li>Initial funding from the <acronym title="Office of the Deputy Prime Minister">ODPM</acronym> (<acronym title="Rest In Peace">RIP</acronym>)

<div class="slide">
<h1>HearFromYourMP</h1>
<img align="right" src="shoupsm.png" alt="">
<ul>
<li>The flip-side to WriteToThem
<li>People sign up on the site (again, by postcode), and MPs can choose to post messages for them
<li>Responses can be private, via WriteToThem, or public underneath the message
<li>Drip, drip, drip
</ul>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>TheyWorkForYou</h1>
<img align="right" src="hansard.jpeg" alt="">
<ul>
<li>Set up by volunteers and launched at NotCon in June 2004; recently brought under the mySociety wing

<li>Changes at their end can prove&hellip; frustrating, but some things make it all worthwhile
<li>Runs on its own FreeBSD server, with Xapian as its search engine, a PHP front-end and various bits of Perl and Python behind the scenes.

<h1>Staying on top</h1>
<ul>
<li>Daily updated (when Parliament is in session) from parliament.uk by a Python scraper and parser
<li>Changes at their end can prove&hellip; frustrating, but some things make it all worthwhile
<li>In the House of Lords, Lord Gould said we (well, mySociety) were the &ldquo;probably the biggest single catalyst for political change in this country&rdquo;
<li>In the House of Commons, Jack Straw blamed us this July for an increase in Written Questions by MPs, saying it &ldquo;seems to measure Members' work in quantitative rather than qualitative terms&rdquo;
