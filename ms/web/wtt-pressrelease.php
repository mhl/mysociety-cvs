<p><b>WriteToThem.com (Launching Today) allows British Citizens to
write to any of their elected representatives, from MPs to
councillors, easily and for free.</b></p>

<div class="heading">
What it Does
</div>

<p>mySociety is pleased to announce the beta launch of 
<a href="http://www.writetothem.com">WriteToThem.com</a>
WriteToThem.com allows any British
citizen to discover the identity of and then send a message to any of
their elected representatives, for free.</p>

<p>When a user visits the site, they enter a postcode, after which they
are shown a list of their elected representatives, along with their
various remits. WriteToThem covers Councillors, Members of Parliament,
Members of the European Parliament, Northern Irish, Welsh and London
assembly members, and members of the Scottish Parliament. The service
then faxes or emails the
representatives accordingly. The focus on ultra-usability keeps the
skill, time and hassle required to an absolute minimum.</p>

<div class="heading">
The Goal
</div>

<p>Much is written about the reasons why democracy appears to be in
trouble. mySociety believes that one of the simplest explanations is
that it isn't easy enough for citizens to get in touch with their
elected representatives. Most people don't know who their councillors,
or MEPs, or MPs are, let alone how to get in touch with them.
FaxYourMP proved over several years that if you provide a simple,
attractive system that is trusted by both citizens and
representatives, you will successfully build better connections
between the electorate and the elected. 60% of people using FaxYourMP
reported that they'd never contacted their MPs before.</p>

<p>WriteToThem.com takes this to a new level by connecting citizens with
those crucial but less-well-know representatives; politicians who
often have far more power over the issues they really care about than
just their MPs.</p>

<div class="heading">
mySociety
</div>

<p>mySociety is a charitable project founded by former policy analyst Tom
Steinberg, in conjunction with the grassroots community of volunteers
who built FaxYourMP. It's mission is to build sites that deliver
simple,
tangible benefits to citizens at very low cost per person helped. Tom
was inspired by the success of the hugely popular and multi-award
winning volunteer run FaxYourMP.com. He was especially influenced by the
principles it embodied, but frustrated by what he saw as a failure in
the voluntary and public sectors to understand why this site was so
useful, so popular, and so well loved.</p>

<p>He launched mySociety with a call for ideas and proposal from the
public in October 2003. In March 2004 mySociety was awarded funding
from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's e-innovations fund (see
below), and in September 2004 development started on WriteToThem.com,
the successor to FaxYourMP.com</p>

<p>mySociety is the project of registered charity UKCOD.</p>

<div class="heading">
Public-Voluntary Partnership
</div>

<p>mySociety has been funded by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's
e-Innovation's Fund, through a partnership with West Sussex County
Council. The purpose of the e-Innovation funds is "To encourage
practical examples of new and innovative approaches to joined up
working, effective service delivery and community engagement." By
partnering with mySociety ODPM has tapped into the rich vein of
grassroots civic programming, combining the reach and the resources of
government with the specialist skills and established reputation of
sites like FaxYourMP.com and TheyWorkForYou.com. mySociety will be
producing four more projects from e-innovations funding over the next
few months.</p>

<div class="heading">
Other Support
</div>

<p>mySociety is extremely grateful to 
<a href="http://www.goveval.com">Government Evaluations</a>, a company which gathers and sells contact
data on elected and unelected officials across UK government. GovEval
has sponsored WriteToThem with free provision of data, and we are
hugely grateful for this support.</p>

Quotes
</div>

<p><b>Brian Eno, Musician & Thinker:</b></p>

<p>"Politicians bewail the apathy of voters, but fail to address the
reason: people don't feel engaged in their government, and don't feel
empowered to alter anything that it does in their name. Since this
engagement and empowerment is the fundamental precondition of
democracy, this is a serious deficit.</p>

<p>Tools such as these address this issue by bringing government right
into your living room and onto your monitor. They encourage
engagement, and they encourage the formation of active communities of
interest. It is not an exaggeration to suggest that the future of
democracy might come to depend on them."</p>

<p><b>Richard Allan MP, Member for Sheffield Hallam</b>:

<p>"Well-designed, easy to use, comprehensive and fit for purpose -
WriteToThem is everything a good website should be, and will I am sure
form an important block in building links between people and their
representatives."

<p><b>Roland Mezulis, Chief e-Government Strategist, West Sussex County Council</b>:

<p>"The partnership between West Sussex County Council and mySociety
looks like it will be very fruitful and enable us to develop solutions
that will allow closer community engagement and open new channels for
communication. WriteToThem is the first example of a series of
innovative approaches that the partnership will sponsor and that will
offer new ideas for local
authorities to support sustainable local communities."

<p><b>Stephen Coleman, Professor of e-Democracy, Oxford Internet Institute:</b>

<p>"Representative democracies in the digital age need new communication
tools and ways of facilitating interactive communication. WriteToThem is
a perfect example of such a simple democratic tool."

<p><b>Nigel Evans MP, Member for Ribble Valley and Fulwood:</b></p>

<p>"As an MP it is amazing how many letters I receive which should be
going to other MPs....people take a guess as to who their MP is and
sometimes this involves a delay in getting that correspondence through
to the right MP- this system takes away the mistakes- and therefore
urgent messages can be dealt with more swiftly. It also means that the
constituent doesnt need to be overly concerned by any boundary changes
that will happen after the next election, and is happening in Scotland
at this election.

<p>I want to be contactable, and I would encourage as many constituents
to use this system as possible. Instant communications is the name of
the game, and this tool will deliver it to a growing number of people"
