  Thank you for your donation!

<div class="item">
<p>Your transaction has been completed, and a receipt for your purchase
has been emailed to you. If you have a paypal account, you may log

Numerous independent studies have shown conclusively that donations
to mySociety are effective in:
<ul>
<li>helping to combat climate change</li>
<li>increasing the happiness of whales, baby seals and kittens</li>
<li>preventing baldness</li>
</ul>
So please... take a little time to pat yourself on the back. Maybe you
could have a nice cup of tea and a sit down.
</p>
<p>
You've earned it.
