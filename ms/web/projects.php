<div class="item_inner_head">
<a href="http://www.writetothem.com">WriteToThem.com - Launched 14th February 2005</a>
</div>
<div class="item">
WriteToThem.com is the definitive place to contact any of your elected
representatives. Enter a single postcode and it'll tell you who all
your local representatives are, and a bit about who you should contact
for which reasons. An award winner within 12 weeks of launching,
WriteToThem.com sent 5000 messages in its first month of operation.

<div class="item_inner_head">
<a href="http://www.notapathetic.com">NotApathetic.com - Launched 7th April 2005</a>
</div>
<div class="item">
NotApathetic was built so that people who were planning not to vote in
the UK General Election on May 5th 2005 had the chance to tell the
world why. Non-judgmental and non-partisan NotApathetic caught the
attention of 40,000 visitors during the general election, and was
discussed on a dozen local radio stations, and in newspapers from New
Zealand to South Africa. A dataset of categorized explanations will be
made available from NotApathetic.com in the summer of 2005.

<div class="item_inner_head">
<a href="http://www.pledgebank.com">PledgeBank.com - Launched 13th June 2005</a>
</div>
<div class="item">
PledgeBank is about reassuring people who want to do something altruistic or
socially beneficially that they won't be alone in their actions. It lets users
create pledges which say "I'll do something, but only if 10 other people will
do something", for example "I'll clean up the banks of my local river, but only
if 5 other local people will pledge to come and help.
