<div class="item_inner_head">
<a href="http://www.writetothem.com">WriteToThem.com - Launched 14th February 2005</a>
</div>
<div class="item">
WriteToThem.com is the definitive place to contact any of your elected
representatives. Enter a single postcode and it'll tell you who all
your local representatives are, and a bit about who you should contact
for which reasons. An award winner within 12 weeks of launching,
WriteToThem.com sent 5000 messages in its first month of operation.

<div class="item_inner_head">
<a href="http://www.notapathetic.com">NotApathetic.com - Launched 7th April 2005</a>
</div>
<div class="item">
NotApathetic was built so that people who were planning not to vote in
the UK General Election on May 5th 2005 had the chance to tell the
world why. Non-judgmental and non-partisan NotApathetic caught the
attention of 40,000 visitors during the general election, and was
discussed on a dozen local radio stations, and in newspapers from New
Zealand to South Africa. A dataset of categorized explanations will be
made available from NotApathetic.com in May 2005.

Sites In Testing
</div>
<div class="item_inner_head">
<a href="http://www.pledgebank.com">PledgeBank.com - working and needs testing</a>
</div>
<div class="item">
PledgeBank.com is a site to help people get things done, especially
things that require several people. We think that the world needs such
a service: lots of good things don't happen because there aren't
enough organised people to do them. We are looking for people to help
test the site, so please do pay the testing site a visit.
