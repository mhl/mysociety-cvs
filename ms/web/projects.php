<div class="item_inner_head">
<a href="http://www.hearfromyourmp.com">HearFromYourMP.com - Launched 21st November 2005</a>
</div>
<div class="item">
HearFromYourMP encourages and enables MPs to run email lists for their
constituents, and to allow those constituents to discuss ideas in a way which
doesn't bombard them with email.  5000 people had signed up before it was even
launched.
</div>

<div class="item_inner_head">
<a href="http://www.pledgebank.com">PledgeBank.com - Launched 13th June 2005</a>
</div>
<div class="item">
PledgeBank is about reassuring people who want to do something altruistic or
socially beneficially that they won't be alone in their actions. It lets users
create pledges which say "I'll do something, but only if 10 other people will
do something", for example "I'll clean up the banks of my local river, but only
if 5 other local people will pledge to come and help.

<div class="item_inner_head">
<a href="http://www.notapathetic.com">NotApathetic.com - Launched 7th April 2005</a>
</div>
<div class="item">
NotApathetic was built so that people who were planning not to vote in
the UK General Election on May 5th 2005 had the chance to tell the
world why. Non-judgmental and non-partisan NotApathetic caught the
attention of 40,000 visitors during the general election, and was
discussed on a dozen local radio stations, and in newspapers from New
Zealand to South Africa.

<div class="item_inner_head">
<a href="http://www.writetothem.com">WriteToThem.com - Launched 14th February 2005</a>
</div>
<div class="item">
WriteToThem.com is the definitive place to contact any of your elected
representatives. Enter a single postcode and it'll tell you who all
your local representatives are, and a bit about who you should contact
for which reasons. An award winner within 12 weeks of launching,
WriteToThem.com sent 5,000 messages in its first month of operation.
</div>

<div class="item_inner_head">
<a href="http://www.theyworkforyou.com">TheyWorkForYou.com - Launched 6th June 2004</a>
</div>
<div class="item">
TheyWorkForYou provides a searchable, annotatable version of what is said in
Parliament, as well as useful pages providing clear, non-biased information on
a range of different measures of activities by MPs.  Originally built by
volunteers while mySociety was getting started, it is now part of mySociety.

<div class="item_inner_head">
<a href="http://petitions.pm.gov.uk">E-Petitions - Launched 14th November 2006</a>
</div>
<div class="item">
We built the 10 Downing Street e-Petitions site as a civil service commissioned
project to allow members of the public to petition the Prime Minister about
whatever issues they see fit. Highly robust and load-tolerant, it is also
available as open source code for reuse elsewhere.

<div class="item_inner_head">
Neighbourhood Fix-It
</div>
<div class="item">
A site where people can report, view, or discuss local problems like graffiti,
fly tipping, broken paving slabs, or street lighting. We're making this 
in collaboration with the <a href="http://www.youngfoundation.org.uk/">Young
Foundation</a>.

<div class="item_inner_head">
Freedom of Information Filer and Archive
</div>
<div class="item">
We're building a website to help people make Freedom of Information requests
from different parts of government. It will then archive the responses on the
web. We've got <a
href="http://www.mysociety.org/2006/12/06/funding-for-freedom-of-information/">funding
from one of Joseph Rowntree's trusts</a> for this (yes, the dead chocolate mogul;
eat lots of chocolate, it'll help mySociety's successors in the 22nd century).
