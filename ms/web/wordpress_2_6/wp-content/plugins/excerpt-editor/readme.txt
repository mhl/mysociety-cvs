Quick edit or create excerpts for both Posts and Pages, auto-generate and append excerpts or replace the content with excerpts.


== Description ==

Excerpt Editor provides a convenient place for creating and editing all excerpts. It can also add custom excerpts for pages (not possible without a plugin). Features: auto-creating excerpts when publishing new Posts and Pages, displaying customisable excerpts from the content for posts without an excerpt, appending excerpts from the latest posts to each Post or from the sub-pages to each Page, replacing the content for all archive and tags pages with excerpts (eliminates content duplication for SEO).

The excerpts can be used in the RSS feed, displayed on the Home or Archive pages and/or used for meta descriptions. The excerpts can be in any language supported by WordPress and the plugin contains .pot file to facilitate translations.


= Changelog =

Version 1.1: Updated for WordPress 2.5, removed auto-creation of excerpts on saving or editing. 

Version 1.0: Added option to replace the content with the excerpt on the Home page, all archive pages and/or all tags pages. This eliminates content duplication (SEO). Added option to append excerpts to Posts and Pages. 

Version 0.3.2: Fixed: when editing Pages, WordPress would delete the custom excerpts. New option: if *Read More* link is used, it can contain comments count. New option: display the *Excerpt* box when writing/editing Pages.

Version 0.3.1: Fixed: properly append the "Read More" link when auto-generating excerpts. Now using nonce fields when deleting or saving excerpts. The code is organized in a class for better compatibility.
