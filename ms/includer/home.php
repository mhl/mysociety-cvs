	<h3>Hello! We are mySociety &ndash; we run most of 
	the UK’s best known democracy websites.</h3>
	<p>
Helped by our services, <strong>200,000</strong> people have written to their
MP for the first time, over <strong>8,000</strong> potholes and other broken
things have been fixed, nearly <strong>9,000,000</strong> signatures have been
left on petitions to the Prime Minister, and at least <strong>77</strong> tiny
hats have been knitted for charity.

	<p>mySociety is built on volunteers; from simple things, like playing a
	game to help us make sense of video from the House of Commons, or
	reporting a broken paving slab, to building a new service with our data
	or helping us look after one of our websites.</p>
	
	<p>Or just joining our discussion groups and telling us how to make stuff better.
