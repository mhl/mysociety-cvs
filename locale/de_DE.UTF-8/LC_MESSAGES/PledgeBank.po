"Subject: You MUST publicise your pledge to make it succeed - '<?=$values['title']?>' at PledgeBank.com\n"
"\n"
"Hello, we've noticed that the pledge you set up hasn't been, erm, growing very\n"
"quickly.  Just to remind you, we're talking about '<?=$values['sentence_first']?>'\n"
"at <?=$values['pledge_url']?>\n"
"\n"
"PledgeBank relies on you, the creator, to publicise and spread your pledge -\n"
"very few pledges succeed just because casual browsers happen to sign them.\n"
"There are a number of ways of promoting your pledge:\n"
"\n"
"1. Email everyone you can think of and tell them about your pledge.  Don't\n"
"forget old colleagues, and that kind of half-friend who mailed you once and you\n"
"never got round to replying to.\n"
"\n"
"<?=$values['pledge_url_email']?>\n"
"\n"
"2. Print out some flyers and post them up at work, at a newsagent or a take-away\n"
"that you go to.  Probably the best way of using flyers is to put them through\n"
"people's doors, or give them to people at the school gates, the local train\n"
"station, or wherever you feel comfortable.\n"
"\n"
"<?=$values['pledge_url_flyers']?>\n"
"\n"
"3. When you are out with friends, explain to them what you're trying to do, and\n"
"get them to text two words - pledge <?=$values['ref']?> - to\n"
"<?=$values['sms_number']?> (UK only at the moment, sorry; texts cost your\n"
"normal text rate).\n"
"\n"
"So don't just sit there! Fire up your email, fill up the printer, write to your\n"
"local newspaper and, of course, don't forget to get the words \"Text 'pledge\n"
"<?=$values['ref']?>' to <?=$values['sms_number']?>\" tattooed to your forehead.\n"
