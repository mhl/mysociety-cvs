<h3 id="beta">BETA TEST</h3>

<p>
The e-petitions system launched in November 2006. It is currently
in a public "beta test". This means that users are welcome to sign
and create petitions, but we will be making changes to the site,
as we fix technical problems, improve usability and respond to
feedback. A series of changes have already been made after our
<a href="http://www.pm.gov.uk/output/Page10655.asp">review of the first month</a>.
</p>

<p><strong>Update from the e-Petitions team - Why not "sign against" petitions?</strong></p>
 
<p>Many people have suggested changes to the e-petitions service during this
test phase, and a number of improvements have been made as a result.</p>

<p>One of the most popular proposals has been the creation of a 'sign against'
mechanism, which would allow users to disagree with petitions. After much
discussion, we have decided not to add this function.</p>

<p>The rationale is this: "e-petitions" is designed essentially as a modern
equivalent of the traditional petitions presented at the door of No.10. It
enables people to put their views to the Prime Minister. It is not intended to
be a form of quasi-referendum or unrepresentative opinion poll (professional
polls use special techniques to ensure balanced samples). With a "vote against"
function, that is what it would effectively become.</p>

<p>It is of course possible to create a counter-petition to an existing
campaign (as many people already have). This remains the best option if you
disagree with a particular petition.</p>
