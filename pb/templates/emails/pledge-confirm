Please click on the link below to confirm that you wish PledgeBank.com
to display the pledge at the bottom of this email in your name.

By clicking you also consent to the syndication of your pledge to

The purpose of this is simply to give your pledge greater publicity
and a greater chance of succeeding. Rest assured that we won't ever
