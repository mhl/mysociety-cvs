Subject: Your local politicians can help your pledge to grow

Howdy,

We're sorry to report that your pledge still isn't going to succeed
unless you do something to encourage more people to sign up.

Have you thought about writing to your local politicians about it?

If you're in the UK , you can go straight to www.writetothem.com right
now, and write to any of your politicians - we make it really easy.

If you're not in Britain, why not try using a search engine to look
for local politicians.

Remember, the all important part is an explanation of why you think
your pledge matters, and the web address, which is:

<?=$values['pledge_url']?>

Best of luck,

the PledgeBank Team
