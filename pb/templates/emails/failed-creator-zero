Subject: Your pledge - '<?=$values['title']?>' at PledgeBank.com.

Unfortunately, your pledge did not meet its target in the required time. You
required <?=$values['target']?> <?=$values['type']?>, but didn't get any
signatures.

The pledge read: '<?=$values['sentence_first']?>'

Sorry about that. Why not try creating a new pledge, with a lower target
to have more chance of success, and ask your friends or colleagues to sign?

<?=$values['signature']?>
