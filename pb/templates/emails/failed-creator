Subject: PledgeBank pledge failure - '<?=$values['title']?>'

Dear <?=$values['name']?>,

We are sorry to have to tell you that your pledge did not meet its target in
the required time.  You required <?=$values['target']?> <?=$values['type']?>, but achieved 
only <?=$values['actual']?>.

Ah well, better luck next time.
