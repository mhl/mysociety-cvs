Subject: Sorry, your pledge failed - '<?=$values['title']?>' at PledgeBank.com

We are sorry to have to tell you that your pledge did not meet its target in
the required time.  You required <?=$values['target']?> <?=$values['type']?>, but achieved 
only <?=$values['actual']?>.

Better luck next time - maybe you'd like to hit reply and tell us what you
think didn't work out? It might help us give better guidance or build further
useful features in the future.
