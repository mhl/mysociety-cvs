Subject: Sorry, your promise failed - '<?=$values['title']?>' at livesimply

The livesimply promise you created hasn't reached its target within the
timeframe. It required <?=$values['target']?> <?=$values['type']?> to sign
up, but achieved only <?=$values['actual']?>.

The promise read: '<?=$values['sentence_first']?>'

<?=$values['pledge_url']?>

You have three options now. You can always carry out your promise
anyway with the number of people so far, by emailing the others using
the following link: <?=$values['url']?>

You can start the promise with a new timeframe by starting a new
