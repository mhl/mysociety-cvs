Subject: Promise deadline passed - '<?=$values['title']?>' at livesimply

The livesimply promise you signed up to hasn't reached its target within
the timeframe. It required <?=$values['target']?>
<?=$values['type']?> to sign up, but achieved only <?=$values['actual']?>.

The promise, created by <?=$values['creator_name']?>, read:
'<?=$values['sentence_first']?>'

<?=$values['pledge_url']?>

You have three options now:

1) You can always carry out your promise anyway with other people who
signed up. To get them on board you can post a comment using the
'Post a comment' form on the promise page:
<?=$values['pledge_url']?>

2) You can start the promise with a new timeframe by clicking on "Start
a promise": <?=$values['pledgebank_url']?>new

3) You can sign up to a similar promise - check out "All promises":
<?=$values['pledgebank_url']?>list or use
the search box in the top right hand corner.

<?=$values['signature']?>
