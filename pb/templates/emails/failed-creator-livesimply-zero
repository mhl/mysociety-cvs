Subject: The deadline for your promise has passed - '<?=$values['title']?>' at livesimply

The livesimply promise you created hasn't reached its target within the
timeframe. It required <?=$values['target']?> <?=$values['type']?> to sign

The promise read: '<?=$values['sentence_first']?>'

You have two options now. You can start the promise with a new timeframe
