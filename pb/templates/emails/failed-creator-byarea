Subject: Sorry, your pledge failed in <?=$values['location_description']?> - '<?=$values['title']?>' at PledgeBank.com.

We are sorry to have to tell you that your pledge did not meet its target 
for people in <?=$values['location_description']?> in the required time.  You
required <?=$values['target']?> <?=$values['type']?>, but achieved only
<?=$values['location_signers']?>.

The pledge read: '<?=$values['sentence_first']?>'

Bad luck, but don't be disheartened! This link will enable you to write to all
your signers in <?=$values['location_description']?>. Ask them what they'd like
to do next, how you could do better next time, and whether they'd like to
create a new pledge.

<?=$values['url']?>

Go on, get writing!
