Subject: Your pledge '<?=$values['title']?>' at PledgeBank.com was unsuccessful in <?=$values['location_description']?>

Unfortunately, your pledge did not meet its target for people in
<?=$values['location_description']?> in the required time.  You required
<?=$values['target']?> <?=$values['type']?>, but achieved only
<?=$values['location_signers']?>.

The pledge read: '<?=$values['sentence_first']?>'

The link below will enable you to write to all your signers in
<?=$values['location_description']?>. Ask them what they'd like to do next, 
whether they'd like to go through with the plege anyway, or whether they'd
like to create a new pledge.

Go on and get started - good luck!!
