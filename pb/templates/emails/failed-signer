Subject: Pledge failed - '<?=$values['title']?>' at PledgeBank.com

We are sorry to have to inform you that the pledge to which you signed up did
not meet its target in the required time.  It required <?=$values['target']?> <?=$values['type']?>, 
but achieved only <?=$values['actual']?>.

Don't be disheartened!
