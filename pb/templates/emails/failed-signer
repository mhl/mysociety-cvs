Subject: Pledge failed - '<?=$values['title']?>' at PledgeBank.com

We are sorry to have to inform you that the pledge to which you signed up did
not meet its target in the required time.  It required <?=$values['target']?> 
<?=$values['type']?>, but achieved only <?=$values['actual']?>.

The pledge, created by <?=$values['creator_name']?>, read:
'<?=$values['sentence_first']?>'

This means you don't have to do your part of the pledge.  Instead, why not
return to www.pledgebank.com and have a look for other pledges?  Or perhaps
make your own pledge.

<?=$values['signature']?>
