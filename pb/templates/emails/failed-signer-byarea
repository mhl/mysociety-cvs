Subject: Pledge failed in <?=$values['location_description']?> - '<?=$values['title']?>' at PledgeBank.com

We are sorry to have to inform you that the pledge to which you signed up did
not meet its target in your town, <?=$values['location_description']?>, in the
required time.  It required <?=$values['target']?> <?=$values['type']?>, but
achieved only <?=$values['location_signers']?>.

The pledge, created by <?=$values['creator_name']?>, read:
'<?=$values['sentence_first']?>'

This means you don't have to do your part of the pledge.  Instead, why not
sign up to local alerts at <?=$values['pledgebank_url']?>alert to find out
when someone creates a new pledge near you, browse the pledges at
<?=$values['pledgebank_url']?>list or perhaps make your own pledge.

<?=$values['signature']?>
