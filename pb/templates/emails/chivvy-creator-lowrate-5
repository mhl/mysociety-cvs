Subject: Need some help to get your pledge to grow faster?

Hello,

Local newspapers are really keen to know what people are doing to take
control of their own lives, and will often print stories about
interesting ideas.

Why not use a search engine to find your local newspaper, and then
drop them an email with the address of your pledge, and a short
description of why it matters to you that this Pledge succeeds.

The address of your pledge is <?=$values['pledge_url']?>

If you're lucky, they might even send a photographer round, and get
your picture in the papers!
