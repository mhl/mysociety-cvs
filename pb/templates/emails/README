Email templates for PledgeBank.  These are interpreted using PHP, but you
should probably only use the following syntax:

    <?=$values['name_of_variable']?>

Values which are available in all emails are:

  - title, many body text of the pledge saying what pledge setter will do;

  - target, how many people are needed for the pledge to succeed;
    
  - type, description of the people, e.g. "residents of Eglwysbach";

  - signup, description of what pledge signers will do;
    
  - date, deadline for pledge failing;
   
  - detail, extra description of the pledge.

  - sentence_first, full pledge sentence in first person ("I...").

  - sentence_third, full pledge sentence in third person ("Pledge Setter...").

The text of each message should be pre-formatted as an email.
