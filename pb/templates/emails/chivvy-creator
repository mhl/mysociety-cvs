Subject: Helping your pledge along its way - '<?=$values['title']?>' at PledgeBank.com

Hello, we've noticed that the pledge you set up hasn't been, erm, growing very
quickly.  Just to remind you, we're talking about '<?=$values['sentence_first']?>'
at <?=$values['pledge_url']?>

PledgeBank relies on you, the creator, to publicise and spread your pledge -
very few pledges succeed just because casual browsers happen to sign them.
There are a number of ways of promoting your pledge:

1. Email everyone you can think of and tell them about your pledge.  Don't
forget old colleagues, and that kind of half-friend who mailed you once and you
never got round to replying to.

2. Print out some flyers and post them up at work, at a newsagent or a take-away
that you go to.  Probably the best way of using flyers is to put them through
people's doors, or give them to people at the school gates, the local train
station, or wherever you feel comfortable.

3. When you are out with friends, explain to them what you're trying to do, and
get them to text two words - pledge <?=$values['ref']?> - to
<?=$values['sms_number']?> (UK only at the moment, sorry; texts cost your
normal text rate).

So don't just sit there! Fire up your email, fill up the printer, write to your
local newspaper and, of course, don't forget to get the words "Text 'pledge
<?=$values['ref']?>' to <?=$values['sms_number']?>" tattooed to your forehead.
