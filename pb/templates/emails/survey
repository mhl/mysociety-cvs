Subject: Pledge survey - '<?=$values['title']?>' at PledgeBank.com

Four weeks ago, a pledge you signed succeeded, which is great!

This is just a quick automatic email to ask: have you carried out
your pledge yet?

If you HAVE done your pledge, follow the link below:

    <?=$values['survey_url']?>

Obviously, some pledges might take a while until you can carry them
out; if so, you can keep this email safe until you do.  Or, you can
say you've done a pledge at any time by going to Your Pledges.


Just to remind you, the pledge, created by <?=$values['creator_name']?>, reads:
'<?=$values['sentence_first']?>'

<?=$values['signature']?>
