Subject: Pledge survey - '<?=$values['title']?>' at PledgeBank.com

Four weeks ago, a pledge you signed succeeded, which is great!
This is just a quick automatic email to ask if you've done your
pledge yet. Obviously, some pledges might be more long term, and
so you might not yet have been able to - if so, keep this email
safe until you do.

If you've done your pledge, follow the link below:

    <?=$values['survey_url']?>

Just to remind you, the pledge, created by <?=$values['creator_name']?>, reads:
'<?=$values['sentence_first']?>'

<?=$values['signature']?>
