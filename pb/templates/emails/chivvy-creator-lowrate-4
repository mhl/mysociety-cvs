Subject: Your pledge needs to grow faster to succeed - here's a suggestion to help.

Hi,

We've noticed that your pledge is still not growing fast enough to
succeed. We've got a really simply suggestion that works.

Grab a pen, and scribble PLEDGE onto the back of your hand.

Then for the next couple of days when you meet people it will help to
remind to you ask them to sign. Remember, the web page address is
really easy:

<?=$values['pledge_url']?>

Good luck!

<?=$values['signature']?>
