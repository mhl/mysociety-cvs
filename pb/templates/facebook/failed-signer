<fb:notif-subject>Pledge unsuccessful - <?=$values['title']?></fb:notif-subject> 

<p>Unfotunately, the pledge to which you signed up did not meet its target in the
required time.  It required <?=$values['target']?> <?=$values['type']?>, but
achieved only <?=$values['actual']?>.</p>

<p>The pledge, created by <?=$values['creator_name']?>, read:
'<a href="<?=$values['pledge_facebook_url']?>"><?=$values['sentence_first']?></a>'</p>

<p>Depending on the pledge, you can feel free to either move forward with your
part of the pledge anyway or withdraw your pledge (in which case, you need do
nothing). As a next step, feel free to
<a href="<?=$values['pledgebank_url']?>alert">sign up to local alerts</a> to
find out when someone creates a new pledge near you, 
<a href="<?=$values['pledgebank_facebook_url']?>">browse the pledges</a> or
perhaps <a href="<?=$values['pledgebank_facebook_url']?>new">make your own pledge</a>!</p>

<p><?=$values['signature']?></p>

Unfortunately, the pledge
'<a href="<?=$values['pledge_facebook_url']?>"><?=$values['ref']?></a>' 
that you signed did not meet its target in time. Feel free to
<a href="<?=$values['pledge_facebook_url']?>">do what you pledged</a>
anyway, or to withdraw your pledge.
