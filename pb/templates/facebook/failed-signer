Subject: Your pledge - '<?=$values['title']?>' at PledgeBank.com

Unfotunately, the pledge to which you signed up did not meet its target in the
required time.  It required <?=$values['target']?> <?=$values['type']?>, but
achieved only <?=$values['actual']?>.

The pledge, created by <?=$values['creator_name']?>, read:
'<?=$values['sentence_first']?>'

Depending on the pledge, you can feel free to either move forward with your
part of the pledge or withdraw your pledge. As a next step, feel free to
sign up to local alerts at <?=$values['pledgebank_url']?>alert to find out
when someone creates a new pledge near you, browse the pledges at
