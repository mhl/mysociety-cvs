<h2>Tell the world "I'll do it, but only if you'll help me do it"</h2>

<p>
mySociety's director Tom Steinberg explains how PledgeBank works.
You can <a href="tom-on-pledgebank-vbr.mp3">listen to an MP3</a>
of this instead.

<blockquote>Hello.  I'm Tom Steinberg, the director of mySociety, the charitable
group which is building PledgeBank.  I've taken the unusual step of
recording this introduction because PledgeBank is a slightly unusual
idea.  I've found that explaining it in person often works better than
using the written word.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>We all know what it is like to feel powerless, that our own actions
can't really change the things that we want to change.  PledgeBank is
about beating that feeling by connecting you with other people who also
want to make a change, but who don't want the personal risk of being
the only person to turn up to a meeting or the only person to donate ten
pounds to a cause that actually needed a thousand.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>The way it works is simple.  You create a pledge which has the basic
format 'I'll do something, but only if other people will pledge to do
the same thing'.  For example, if you'd always want to organise a street
party you could orgnise a pledge which said 'I'll hold a street party,
but only if three people who live in my street will help me to run it'
</blockquote>

<blockquote>The applications of PledgeBank are limitless.  If you are a parent
you could say that 'I will help run an after hours sports club but only
if 5 other parents will commit one evening a week to doing it '.  If you
are in a band you could say 'I'll hold a gig but only if 40 people will
come along'.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>PledgeBank has been undergoing real world testing for a few weeks
already, and there are already some successful completed pledges
completely outside our original ideas of how people might use the site.
One person gathered 20 other fans of a BBC radio series to lobby for its
release on CD. Another encouraged 8 people who he'd never met to bury
buckets in their own gardens to make homes for endangered stag beatles.
And a member of an online community said he'd organise a 5th birthday
party and now has 30 members of that community saying they'll come
along.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>PledgeBank isn't just limited to people who use the internet a lot.
You can sign up to any pledge with a simple two word text message.
Ideal for getting your friends in the pub involved, people in your street
and so on.  
</blockquote>

<blockquote>PledgeBank is free, easy to use, and needs your involvement
before we can launch.  So if there's something you'd like to achieve in
your community, in your place of employment, your university, amongst
your friends, or in your street.  Please take a look at PledgeBank.com
and create a pledge right now.  Thank you.
