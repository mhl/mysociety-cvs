abusive, threatening, harmful, obscene, profane, sexually oriented,
racially, religiously, ethnically or in any other way offensive.</li>
<li>Don't use inappropriate usernames. Those which can be seen as vulgar or offensive.</li>
<li>Don't pretend you are someone else.</li>
<li>Do not incite people to commit any crime.</li>
<li>If you are under 18 you need to ask your parent/guardian or teacher for permission to start a promise</li>
</ol>

<p>When commenting to other promises or other people's comments to your promise:</p>

<ol>
<li>Don't pretend you are someone else.</li>
<li>Don't swear.</li>
<li>No defamatory comments.</li>
<li>Avoid contempt of court.</li>
<li>Don't abuse the complaints system.</li>
<li>Do not incite people to commit any crime.</li>
<li>Do not post comments that are unlawful, harassing, defamatory, abusive, threatening, harmful, obscene, profane, sexually oriented or racially offensive.</li>
<li>Don't publish personal information.</li>
<li>If you are under 18 you need to ask your parent/guardian or teacher for permission to post comments.</li>
</ol>

<p>Violation of any of the rules above may lead to your membership account/promise being temporarily suspended or terminated.</p>

<h3>Privacy questions</h3>
<p>(from the <a href="/faq">FAQ</a>)</p>

<dl>

<dt>I don't want my name visible to everyone when I sign a promise! <dt>
<dd>You can add yourself secretly to a promise by unchecking the 'Show my name on this promise' box when you sign up. Alternatively, you can sign up by SMS (in the UK only).
</dd>

<dt>Who gets to see my email address? </dt>
<dd><em>live</em>simply network will never disclose your email address to anyone,
including the creator of your promise, unless we are obliged to by law. We do
let the promise creators send emails to promise subscribers to explain what's
going on, to motivate them etc. However, we don't show the promise creator the
addresses of the subscribers getting their email. If you reply to an email from
the promise creator yourself, you will give them your email address &mdash;
please be aware!  <em>live</em>simply network is also reserving the right to use your
email addresses to get in touch with you very occasionally during the life of
the <em>live</em>simply challenge (due to end May 2008). mySociety, who built
the site and run the servers, obviously have access to the email addresses,
but will only use them on behalf of the <em>live</em>simply network for the purposes
described in the rest of this paragraph.</dd>

<dt>Will you send nasty, brutish spam to my email address? </dt>
<dd>Nope. After you sign up to a promise we will only send you emails in relation
to your promise or to the <em>live</em>simply challenge. You may receive a message
from the promise creator, asking how you're getting on, and status emails from
<em>live</em>simply promise stating whether the target has been reached. The
members of the <a href="http://www.progressio.org.uk/livesimply/AssociatesInternal/92992/members/"><em>live</em>simply network</a>
will never give or sell your email addresses to anyone else, unless we are obliged to by law.</dd>

<dt>What is Google Analytics?</dt>
<dd>This website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google.
Google Analytics uses cookies, which are text files placed on your computer, to help
the website analyze how users use the site. The information generated by the cookie
about your use of the website (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and

activity and internet usage.  Google may also transfer this information to third
parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the
information on Google's behalf. Google will not associate your IP address with any
other data held by Google.  You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the
appropriate settings on your browser, however please note that if you do this you
may not be able to use the full functionality of this website.  By using this
website, you consent to the processing of data about you by Google in the manner and
for the purposes set out above.</dd>

</dl>

<h2>For under 18s</h2>

<p>To start or sign up to a promise or to comment to someone else's promise you need to ask your parent/guardian or teacher for permission. </p>

<p>When you start or sign up for a <em>live</em>simply promise, we ask you for an email address. We need this so you can be kept in touch with how the promise is going but we won't be showing your address to anyone else (unless for legal reasons we have to). Your email address is safe and sound with us - that's a promise!</p>

<p>Mind you, if you send an email to someone else who signed up to a promise they will see your email address &mdash; so be careful and make sure your parent/guardian/teacher is aware of it. </p>

<p>Your email address is something personal to you that you should be careful about sharing. When you are asked for your email address by a web site, you need to be clear about what that site is going to do with your address. For all the info you need on staying safe online, go to <a href="http://www.childnet-int.org/projects">http://www.childnet-int.org/projects</a>.</p>
 
<p>If you have any more questions about our terms and conditions, please email <a href="mailto:promise&#64;livesimply.org.uk">promise&#64;livesimply.org.uk</a>.</p>
