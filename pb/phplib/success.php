p(_('&ldquo;Let me thank you first for making the story of Bakul into the Bakul
Story that people want to talk about. After you talked about Bakul at the Net
Squared Conference and to Idealist, of course the podcast happened. And after
that, we became a case study on social entrepreneurship at IIM Calcutta, one of
the premier Business Schools in India and at Delhi University, the premier
University of India. But it all started with you. Thanks once again for that.')) .
p(_('&ldquo;Anyway...Bakul is an attempt to pool together the small individual
contributions of people interested in the social development of India. It is an
attempt to beat the cynicism that nothing can happen because we can only
contribute in small ways and they cannot change anything. That is why, when we
discovered Pledge Bank, we were excited. Here was a forum that was trying to do
a similar thing. So, it was kind of a perfect tool for us in our campaign.')) .
p(_('&ldquo;Moreover, when we started the campaign, "Donate Books: Build a
Library", we got many incredulous responses. Many thought it sounded too good
to be true and doubted its feasibility though they wanted it to happen. We also
did not have a bank account to accept contributions and no space to store
donations of books.  So, the pledge campaign was just perfect. And we told the
skeptics that they anyway did not have to contribute if they did not find a
thousand others foolish enough to believe in it. As we neared our target, more
and more people got involved in the mobilization as even the skeptics wanted
this idea to succeed. As a result of that campaign now we have one of the best

of the livesimply initiative. The initiative is calling people to change
their lifestyle, which is a qualitative objective (i.e it&rsquo;s hard to
measure it with numbers). So having a website where you can get that
colourful data of people&rsquo;s thoughts, experience and opinions can
provide us with some insight in how people are changing their lives.')) .

wanted to create a community of people who make promises so that they can
support each other. We could just go for a simpler system where people
could only make a promise. But we wanted to make sure that they feel that
there is a bit more to it. So the fact that PledgeBank requires you to make
a promise with someone - hence you need to promote it - and the fact that
it has the system for nudging people about their promise (reminding them
about deadlines, the number of sign-ups etc) is what made PledgeBank a very
appropriate tool for us.')) .

p(_('&ldquo;I heard about PledgeBank through reading Michael Norton&rsquo;s
book 365 Ways to Change the World - I bought this book for my sister and I,
as we found that in an evening we would often fall into the habit of
bemoaning the problems of the world and feeling helpless to do anything
about them. One of the major environmental issues in Australia is the lack
of water. my sister and I started thinking if we personally could change
our habits this would be a very small step in the right direction - then we
read about PledgeBank and thought if we could get other individuals to
change their habits this would start adding up!')) .

p(_('&ldquo;I suppose my great hope is that as individuals if we can regain a
sense of personal responsibility for our actions and connection to the
external environment, then the world would be a better place. As opposed to
seeing these major world problems as something someone needs to address,
maybe we could have a greater sense of our own ability to positively change
the present and the future.')) .

p(_('&ldquo;I must say that at first, a shorter shower and a bucket to move
daily seemed to be a sort of strange punishment! But as the days have gone
by this daily action has become something that gives me a great sense of
joy and reconnection to the world. As a household (there are four of us
doing this) we have become more interested in our garden, because rather
than watering it absentmindedly with a hose, we have to really look at what
needs to be watered with our bucket. I have started to notice the growth of
each plant and also I now notice the birds and animals that were probably
there all the time but I was too busy to notice! Instead of long shower,
head to the city - it has become short shower, time in the garden, before
heading to the city.')) .

the pledge&hellip;and that made me really happy.&rdquo;')),
