Geocascading pledges
====================

1. Pledge page comprehensibility
--------------------------------

Work on way pledges are worded, so what they mean (i.e. that they template
across areas) is immediately clear

Finish the map display on ref-index (country code cross lookup, mainly)


2. Place selection
------------------

Experiment more with AJAX gaze search while typing
Try offering mixed list of matching places and nearby signed up places
Maybe show list of nearby places when given postcode
Generally - make it possible to browse places so you can find the suitable one you want to choose
(this stuff is hard in London, as there are lots of possible places, and Gaze doesn't have them all)

Generally - make it easy to hunt for a place near you if you can't find one immediately. 
Specifically, make it possible to undo a wrong choice (if you enter "Highbury" it takes
you straight through, even though you were just experimenting to see if it was right)


3. What happens on success / failure
------------------------------------

Extra announce message - must give choice of sending to successful or failed towns?
Make creator not get zillions of failure message
Preserve text for second and subsequent success message fields

Upon failure, tell signers which nearby towns succeeded

Brainstorm better way of linking people up upon success

In "Pledge failed in Highbury" text, add link to local part of pledge so 
can see who else signed it there (if anyone did)

Success email to signers, it is not clear:
1) How many other people signed it locally for the pledge to have
reached the success threshold.
2) What the total number of signers (15) has to do with the local success.


Other things to do
------------------

Add to "new pledges" interface
* Don't allow local pledges to be byarea, although country ones can be

send-local-alerts can be mega fancy, alerting to new signers of pledges near you

Check how pledges with a PIN behave

Someone asked to be signed up in two areas at once (with same email)


Bugs
----

If you enter Holloway, and you are logged in, it signs the thing immediately
without the option of you choosing.

It says NOTICE in the local alert signup box when you enter really silly
place name with no matches e.g. lkj

Make signing instantly change whensucceeded?
    and do vice versa for the normal pledges

Say explicitly that your place will be made public 

Show country in top message (TODO in gaze_controls_print_places_choice)

Sorting:
    it's the number 1 pledge on http://www.pledgebank.com/list - presumably because the target is 0?

Close to in name of place gets stored rather than translated 
e.g. "Bolton, Bolton (proksime al Bromley)"

"This is a copy of the message you have just sent to everyone=0A= who signed your pledge"
     should say "in $town" for byarea messages

chris: also, why isn't the local alerts ad on ref-sign pre-filled with the location info i've just entered?
