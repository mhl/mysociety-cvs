         <dt>What is this site?</dt>
         <dd>
            It's a game &mdash; pit your aesthetic judgements against other 
            users, and discover the lovely and not so lovely corners of the UK.

            We want to gather a freely available nation-wide dataset of
            scenicness. We want to use it for a secret project, but we're happy to
            make all the data available for other people to use under a Creative
            Commons or other re-use friendly license. 
            
            <p>Suggestions for which one we should use are welcome.</p>
         </dd>
      
         <dt>How do I get in touch?</dt>
         <dd>Email <a href="mailto:team@mysociety.org">team@mysociety.org</a></dd>
      
         <dt>How long will it take before the dataset is available?</dt>
         <dd>            
            That all depends on how many people play the game, and how fast.
            
            <p>There are 217,000 images (one for each of nearly 95% of the 1km grid
            squares in the UK), and we're making sure each one is rated 3 times by
            different people, to help limit abuse, or the impact of people with
            terrible taste.</p>
            
            We'll make the dataset available in a 
            few weeks, by which time it should be big enough to be useful for something.
         </dd>
         
         <dt>What if a photo is unrepresentative of the scenicness of a grid square?</dt>
         <dd>
            At first, there's nothing we can do. When and if we hit 651,000
            million plays we can add a different photo for each grid square, and
            hopefully that will help even out bad photos.
