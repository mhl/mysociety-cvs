         <dt>What is this site?</dt>
         <dd>
            It's a game &mdash; pit your aesthetic judgements against other 
            users, and discover the lovely and not so lovely corners of the UK.

         <dt>Who built it?</dt>
         <dd>
            This site was built by <a href="http://www.thedextrousweb.com">The 
            Dextrous Web</a> for <a href="http://www.mysociety.org">mySociety.org</a>

         <dt>Are you going to add more things?</dt>
         <dd>
            Yes! We'll be adding a page to display the top 10 prettiest and ugliest places
            we've found so far. We also plan to add some way to get the data out, so that 
            you can use it yourselves. Watch this space.
      
         <dt>Where are all the pictures from?</dt>

         <dt>Why did you build it?</dt>
         <dd>
            We want to gather a freely available nation-wide dataset of
            scenicness. We want to use it for a secret project, but we're happy to
            make all the data available for other people to use under a Creative
            Commons or other re-use friendly license. Suggestions for which one we
            should use welcome.
         </dd>
      
         <dt>How do I get in touch?</dt>
         <dd>Email <a href="mailto:team@mysociety.org">team@mysociety.org</a></dd>
      
         <dt>How long will it take before the dataset is available?</dt>
         <dd>            
            That all depends on how many people play the game, and how fast.
            There are 217,000 images (one for each of nearly 95% of the 1km grid
            squares in the UK), and we're making sure each one is rated 3 times by
            different people, to help limit abuse, or the impact of people with
            *terrible* taste. So the game has to be played a total of about .75
            million times before the dataset is ready for first use.
         </dd>
         
         <dt>What if a photo is unrepresentative of the scenicness of a grid square?</dt>
         <dd>
            At first, there's nothing we can do. When and if we hit 0.75
            million plays we can add a different photo for each grid square, and
            hopefully that will help even out bad photos.
