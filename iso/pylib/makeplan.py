'''Finds shortest route from all points on a public transport network to arrive
at a given destination at a given time. Uses Dijkstra's algorithm to do this
all in one go.


A Railway Story
===============

Thomas was a cheeky tank engine who worked on the island of Sodor. He had a
branch line all to himself. 

The fat director made sure that passengers would always know when Thomas would
be at each station. He published the North Western Railway timetable for free
in the ATCO-CIF file format.

#>>> logging.basicConfig(level=logging.getLevelName('DEBUG'))

>>> atco = PlanningATCO() # PlanningATCO is derived from mysociety.atcocif.ATCO
>>> atco.read(sys.path[0] + "/fixtures/thomas-branch-line.cif")

Thomas proudly puffs up and down through six stations. 
>>> [ location.long_description() for location in atco.locations if location.point_type == 'R' ]
['Knapford Rail Station, Knapford, Sodor', 'Dryaw Rail Station, Dryaw, Sodor', 'Toryreck Rail Station, Toryreck, Sodor', 'Elsbridge Rail Station, Elsbridge, Sodor', 'Hackenbeck Rail Station, Hackenbeck, Sodor', 'Ffarquhar Rail Station, Ffarquhar, Sodor', 'Vicarstown Rail Station, Vicarstown, Sodor', 'Ballahoo Rail Station, Ballahoo, Sodor', 'Norramby Rail Station, Norramby, Sodor', "Crovan's Gate Rail Station, Crovan's Gate, Sodor"]

On weekdays he makes four journeys a day, two there, and two back.
>>> monday = datetime.date(2007,1,8)
>>> [ journey.route_direction for journey in atco.journeys 
...   if journey.is_valid_on_date(monday) and journey.operator == 'NWR' ]
['O', 'I', 'O', 'I', 'O', 'I', 'O']

On Sundays he makes only one trip there and back.
>>> sunday = datetime.date(2007,1,14)
>>> [ journey.route_direction for journey in atco.journeys 
...   if journey.is_valid_on_date(sunday) ]
['O', 'I']

There was a passenger who had a new job at the Lead and Uranium mines near
Toryreck. She wanted to know where she could live, and arrive in time for work
at 8am by train.

First she made indices of all the journeys and stations, and worked out which
she could walk between.
>>> atco.precompute_for_dijkstra()

Then she called do_dijkstra to find out all the best routes that arrive from
every place in the network at Toryreck by 8am on a Monday. She was given a
results and a routes data structure in return.
>>> (results, routes) = atco.do_dijkstra("TORYRECK", datetime.datetime(2007,1,8, 8,0))

results contained a dictionary with each station on the network from which she
can arrive at work on time, and the latest time at which you need to leave that
station.
>>> results
[('TORYRECK', datetime.datetime(2007, 1, 8, 8, 0)), ('DRYAW', datetime.datetime(2007, 1, 8, 7, 20)), ('KNAPFORD', datetime.datetime(2007, 1, 8, 7, 0))]

routes gave her details of the best route she could take from each station. A
route consisted of a list of place/times, in reverse order starting with the
target destination, and ending with the place/time that appeared in the results
dictionary.
>>> print atco.pretty_print_routes(results, routes),
Journey times to TORYRECK by 08:00:00

A second passenger wanted to be in Dryaw at 7:22 for breakfast with a friend.
The 7:00 from Knapford arrives at Dryaw at 7:20, so that train should be
returned as a result. Also a test that checks interchange times in the middle
of journeys, plus you can walk from Toryreck in 50 minutes!

The Anopha Quarry manager wanted to get to work by 9:15am. He had to get a bus
from the end of the railway line.

Notes on using with NPTDR data

2008 data is valid in week 6-12 October 2008 only.

Routing does not allow for train routing guides or easements - the journeys
generated are possible, but you have to buy the right ticket(s).
