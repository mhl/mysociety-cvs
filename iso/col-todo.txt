Contours of life ideas
======================

Journey home, as well as journey to work

Flakiness metric 
- e.g. some measure of mean and variance of waiting time to go home between
  5pm/6pm, giving you a measure of chance of you getting home
  if you leave work at a random time in that interval. 
- Plot distribution of getting home time for leaving in a range?

Journeys changing at school holiday can really matter - get
data for this (not in NPTDR) and offer flakiness across time metric.
