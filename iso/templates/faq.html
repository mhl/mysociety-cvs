<dt>What is Mapumental?</dt>
<dd>
<p>It's a tool that uses lovely maps to help you work out where in Britain
you might like to live, work or visit for a holiday.</p>
</dd>

<dt>How do I use it?</dt>
<dd>
<p>At the moment Mapumental is best at helping you work out where else you might
live to have a better daily commute. This will change in the future, but for
now, here's how to use it.</p>

<p>First, enter a postcode for a place of work, a college, or anywhere you have
to be regularly.</p>

<p>Mapumental will then create and show you a map of a few miles around the
postcode you entered, with a big splodge in the middle. That splodge represents
every location you could live if you needed to get to your workplace by 9am,
assuming you want to travel less than an hour by public transport.</p>

<p>Now for the clever bit. Let's say you don't want to commute for an hour, but
you'd be happy with half an hour. What you do now is grab the slider and slide
it to the right, until it says 'Departing at 8.30'. As you do this you'll see
the splodge change size and shape to show only those places half an hour or
less away from your chosen destination.</p>

</dd>

<dt>What about the house prices slider?</dt>

<dd>

<p>It isn't much use knowing that an area is an acceptable commute to your chosen
destination if you can't possibly afford to live there.</p>

<p>Grab the slider and slide it up and down to hide places that are too expensive.</p>

<p>Now you can see places which are both 30 minutes or less away, AND which cost
an acceptable amount.</p>

<p>Sorry - we don't have house prices for Scotland. They wanted to sell them for
an outrageous price, so we said no.</p>

</dd>

<dt>And scenicness - what's that?</dt>

<dd>

<p>Some people like to live in or near places that are pretty. The scenicness
slider lets you hide places with a low 'scenicness' score.</p>

</dd>

<dt>How do the sliders combine?</dt>

<dd>

<p>All the sliders can be set to different positions, and they always produce a
single map for you to look at. What the sliders do is effectively hide places
that are too far in time, too expensive and too ugly, leaving you with a map of
what's left.</p>

<p>If you set the sliders to an impossible combination, it'll simply show you
nothing - that's because there isn't anywhere you can live 10 minutes from
Mayfair and pay under £25k for a house, sorry :) </p>

</dd>

<dt>What comes next?</dt>

<dd>

<p>Ooh, lots of things, including:</p>

<ul>
    <li> Building the system to scale industrially, so we can make it fully
public. It is a very high bandwidth and computationally intensive website, so
this will take a little more time.</li>
    <li> Allowing you to choose journeys arriving at more times than just 9am.</li>
    <li> Allowing you to choose journeys that leave after a specified time,
rather than arrive (good for planning holidays).</li>
    <li> Allowing multiple centres, so you can see places to live within 40
minutes of two different places of work (for couples, say).</li>
    <li> More stuff that our users suggest...</li>
</ul>

<h2>Behind the scenes</h2>

<dl>

<dt>Who built this?</dt>

<dd>

<p><a href="http://www.mysociety.org/">mySociety</a>, in partnership with 
<a href="http://www.4ip.org.uk/">Channel 4's 4IP</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://flourish.org/">Francis Irving</a> from mySociety was lead
developer, and <a href="http://www.dracos.co.uk/">Matthew Somerville</a> helped a
lot too. The scale of technical challenge this project represented was simply
awesome, and they rose to the occasion.</p>

<p>The slidey, zoomey, splodgey flash front end was made by <a
href="http://stamen.com">Stamen</a>, who remain quite peerless in the field of
geovisualisation online.</p>

<p>Nearly 15,000 people who played <a href="http://scenic.mysociety.org/">ScenicOrNot</a>, 
who helped create the scenicness data layer.</p>

<p>And Chris Lightfoot, of course, <a href="http://www.mysociety.org/2006/travel-time-maps/">pioneered the whole thing</a>.</p>

</dd>

<dt>Where do the background maps come from?</dt>

<dd>
They're <a href="http://openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a>, made by their wonderful, 
insanely hard-working magical internet pixies.
</dd>


<dt>Where does the public transport data come from?</dt>
<dd>Traveline, it's called the National Public Transport Data Repository. 
It costs about £9000 inc. VAT, if you're in the market yourself.
</dd>

<dt>How accurate is the transport data?</dt>

<dd>The journey times shown are a moderately good reflection of reality, but
with lots of caveats and you should <strong>not</strong> use them for planning
actual journeys.  We take absolutely no responsibility if you do something
stupid like buy a house in the middle of a lake because you thought it looked
like a sensible option on our maps. Check first!
</dd>

<dt>When was the transport data captured?</dt>

<dd>One Tuesday in October last year.
</dd>

<dt>What modes of transport are covered?</dt>

<dd>Trains, buses, coaches, the underground, trams and ferries. Air travel is
not included at all, because NPTDR only contains flights connecting to
Scotland. International sea and rail journeys are not included, either.
</dd>

<dt>What are the interchange times and walking speeds?</dt>

<dd>My - you really do want to know details, don't you? The public transport
journey times assume you can walk at 3mph as the crow flies. 10 minutes walking
is allowed between stations and to/from your final destination. 30 minutes
walking is allowed at the other end of the journey, partly so it displays
clearly on the map.  1 minute is allowed to change buses at the same stop, and
5 minutes for changing train, coach, underground and ferry at the same
station.</dd>

<dt>How are the house prices calculated?</dt>

<dd>We bought a list of every actual domestic property sale recorded with the
Land Registry for England and Wales between the start of January 2008 and the
end of March 2009. They are being displayed with a weighted, inverse distance
decaying mean (see <a href="http://www.gdal.org/grid_tutorial.html">GDAL documentation</a>). 
No attempt has been made to deflate house prices forward to one time
period.</dd>

<dt>Why are there no house prices in Scotland?</dt>

<dd>It turns out that to find out the cost of a house in Scotland costs
about ten times more than to find one in England and Wales. Maybe
they're ten times nicer houses? Who knows, but we ain't paying.
</dd>

<dt>Where is the scenicness data from?</dt>

<dd>People vote on the scenicness of photos of Britain on
<a href="http://scenic.mysociety.org/">ScenicOrNot</a>, a site we made specially
to create the data for this one. Please go there and help improve the data! The
photos ultimately come from <a href="http://www.geograph.org.uk/">Geograph</a>.
The scenicness is display on the map with a similar weighted, inverse distance
mean to the one used for house prices as described above.
