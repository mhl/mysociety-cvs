<dt>What is this site?</dt>
<dd>This is a site that provides users with maps that help them find
places to live, work or holiday.</dd>

<dt>How do I use it?</dt>
<dd>Put in a postcode for your home or your place of work. When the map
appears, it will show you everywhere else in the UK that you could
start from in order to reach your chosen location by public transport by 9am. So, if you
put in your place of work, it&rsquo;ll show you everywhere you could live in
order to have a public transport commute that would take less than an hour.</dd>

<dt>What happens if I move the slider?</dt>
<dd>The slider changes the amount of time it takes to get to the
destination you&rsquo;ve chosen. So if you set it to 30 minutes, it&rsquo;ll show
you everywhere you can start if you want to leave after
8.30am.</dd>

<h2>How to use the maps</h2>

<dt>How do I use it to help me house hunt?</dt>
<dd>Put in the postcode of your place of work. Move the slider to the
length of commute that you&rsquo;re willing to tolerate. House hunt only in
places highlighted.</dd>

<dt>How can it help me job hunt?</dt>
<dd>Put in the postcode of your current home. Move the slider to the
length of commute that you&rsquo;re willing to tolerate. Job hunt only in
places highlighted. <em>This would be better if we let you pick multiple
times and/or have &ldquo;depart after&rdquo; as well as &ldquo;arrive by&rdquo;.</em></dd>

<dt>How can it help me holiday?</dt>
<dd>Put in the postcode of your current home. Zoom out so you can see
more of the country. Then set the slider to an acceptable number of
hours you&rsquo;re willing to travel to go on your holiday.
<em>This would be better if we let you have &ldquo;depart after&rdquo; as well
as &ldquo;arrive by&rdquo;, and pick your departure time.</em></p>

<h2>Behind the scenes</h2>

<dl>

<dt>Where does the public transport data come from?</dt>
<dd>Traveline, it's called the National Public Transport Data Repository. We
had to buy it from the public body for nearly Â£9000 quid, just so you can have
this service for free. Dumb, eh?</dd>

<dt>What day are the public transport journey times for?</dt>

<dd>The journey times shown are rough only, and you should <strong>not</strong>
use them for planning actual journeys. They are only valid for one Tuesday in
October last year, and the transport services will have changed since then.
</dd>

<dt>What modes of transport are covered?</dt>

<dd>Trains, buses, coaches, the underground, trams and ferries. Air travel is
not included at all, because NPTDR only contains flights connecting to
Scotland. International sea and rail journeys are not included.
</dd>

<dt>What are the interchange times and walking speeds?</dt>

<dd>The public transport journey times assume you can walk at 3mph as the crow
flies. 10 minutes walking is allowed between stations and to/from your final
destination. 30 minutes walking is allowed at the other end of the journey,
partly so it displays clearly on the map.  1 minute is allowed to change buses
at the same stop, and 5 minutes for changing train, coach, underground and
ferry at the same station.</dd>

<dt>How are the house prices calculated?</dt>

<dd>We bought a list of every actual domestic property sale recorded with the
Land Registry for England and Wales between the start of January 2008 and the
end of March 2009. They are being displayed with a weighted, inverse distance
decaying mean (see 
<a href="https://secure.mysociety.org/cvstrac/rlog?f=mysociety/iso/tiles/HeatGrids.py">source
    code</a> and <a href="http://www.gdal.org/grid_tutorial.html">GDAL documentation</a>). 
No attempt has been made to deflate house prices forward to one time
period.</dd>

<dt>Why are there no house prices in Scotland?</dt>

<dd>It turns out that to find out the cost of a house in Scotland costs
about ten times more than to find one in England and Wales. Maybe
they're ten times nicer houses? Who knows, but we ain't paying.
</dd>

<dt>Where is the scenicness data from?</dt>

<dd>People vote on the scenicness of photos of Britain on
<a href="http://scenic.mysociety.org/">ScenicOrNot</a>, a site we specially
made to create the data for this one. Please go there and help improve the
data! The photos ultimately come from <a href="http://www.geograph.org.uk/">Geograph</a>.
The scenicness is display on the map with a similar weighted, inverse distance
mean to the one used for house prices as described above.


<dt>Who are you?</dt>
<dd>We are <a href="http://www.mysociety.org/">mySociety</a>, a charity that
builds useful websites. For example, you can report potholes
or abandoned mozarella cheese using <a href="http://www.fixmystreet.com">FixMyStreet</a>, 
and check up on your MP's expenses using <a href="http://www.theyworkforyou.com">TheyWorkForYou</a>.
