<p>Your map is in a queue waiting to be made; you are at <strong>position
{{ state.ahead }}</strong> (out of {{ state.new }}).
</p>

<p>
Currently, {{ state.working }} map{{ state.working|pluralize:" is,s are" }} being made,
and we&rsquo;ve guesstimated it&rsquo;ll take {{ approx_waiting_time }} seconds until
yours is done.</p>

<p>This page will automatically refresh until it is done; if this doesn&rsquo;t
work in your browser, please wait a few seconds and then
<a href="{{ self }}">see if your map is ready</a>.</p>
