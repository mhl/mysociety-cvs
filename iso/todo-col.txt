Contours of life TODO
=====================

Test Python routing automatically against C++
earliest_departure in C++?

Test proximity finder against brute proximity finder with all data set

Make close up Skye map for FD
Find out why Ardvasar doesn't have any buses arriving at it

Move code into separate cpplib place

Worry about the places we've stripped because they don't have a location
field in ATCO-CIF. Should we be loading their coordinates from NaPTAN?

Interchange times
- find proper ones to use for TRAIN and BUS
- possibly load QV records if needed to discriminate times
- need another longer time for QVNAIR/12? (should we be including air at all?)
- measures according to type of journey before, not pair of before/after

Thomas CIF file
---------------
Check that all the ids and train operation numbers and stuff in journey parts are ok - I think that they are MPS
Add direct services to Tidmouth
Add some services run by Daisy on Thomas's line
Reduced Sunday service

Later
-----

Handle journeys after midnight - currently it just cuts them short at midnight.
   Instead probably needs to make two copies of them one for each day. Indeed,
   to do all this really well, need to make a copy of every journey for yesterday.
Reverse - allow finding earliest time arrive elsewhere leaving an origin location


Larger ideas
============

Make sure is automatically updated with mid-year new batches of data

Currently we have:
    "how long does it take to get from everywhere, to arrive by 9am at target"
Could have:
    "how long does it take to get to everywhere, leaving target at 5pm"
And then fancier (or at least, fancier seeming, not mathematically so)
    "how long does it take to get from target, to arrive anywhere by 9am"
    "how long does it take to get to target, leaving anywhere at 5pm"

Instead of just "how quickly from each place can I arrive by 9am at target", do
"where leaving 

Flakiness metric 
- e.g. some measure of mean and variance of waiting time to go home between
  5pm/6pm, giving you a measure of chance of you getting home
  if you leave work at a random time in that interval. 
- Plot distribution of getting home time for leaving in a range?

Journeys changing at school holiday can really matter - get
data for this (not in NPTDR) and offer flakiness across time metric.
