Unobvious TODOs:
----------------

Copyright messages and license agreement on source code

Encrypt who=va- in URL
Probably pc= after the first page or two?

Perhaps verify postcode again when fax is submitted

Make sure debug log messages can't print data which should be encrypted ;(
    (maybe not a problem if all /inputs/ are, except for scraping)

Validate HTML

Perhaps strengthen rigour of basic checks for existence of all users
address details etc.

Ordering of display in who.php

Consider removing voting_area from dadem return value
