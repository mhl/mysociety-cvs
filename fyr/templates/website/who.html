<p>Please <strong>*ONLY*</strong> use this service to fax Tony Blair if you are one of his
<strong>constituents</strong> in Sedgefield. Many people from outside of Mr
Blair's constituency have been abusing the service by sending faxes to his
constituency office via WriteToThem.com</p>

<p><a href="/about-qa#onlyrep">Click here to understand why this is A Bad Thing</a>.

<p>If you NOT a constituent of Sedgefield and wish to contact Tony Blair, you
may write to him at the address below:<p>
<blockquote>
The Rt Hon Tony Blair <br />
Prime Minister<br />
10 Downing Street<br />
London<br />

<p>Alternatively, Number 10's website has <a
