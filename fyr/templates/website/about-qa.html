<dd>
<p>All you need is your postcode to start &mdash; you do <em>not</em> need a fax
machine. Just go to the front page of the site, type it in and hit the "Go"
button. Up will pop details of all your local representatives. Select the one
you want, and press 'next'. This will take you straight to a simple form in
which you can start writing straight away. Don't forget to fill in your Name,
Address and Email &mdash; we can't send the message without these.</p>

<p>Now you can get in touch with any of your representatives directly.
WriteToThem.com saves you the trouble of sending your letter through the
traditional routes.  There's no cost to you &mdash; bar the cost of you being online
in the first place.</p>

<p>Being part way through the process, you can choose to go offline if you 
like (keeping your browser windows open), to save yourself a bit of cash. 
Write the letter you wish to send in the word processing program you 
use every day, then when you are happy with it, dial in to your ISP again 
and just copy and paste your letter into the message form. The form will also 
ask you for your full name, address and email address. These personal 
details are to verify who you are, and to allow your representative to reply
to you.</p>

<p>Next, press the "Preview" button to view your letter before sending it.
Take a look to see if you have made your point or request as well as you
want to. If you are not happy, you can click on "edit this Message" to go
back to the original form, and change your letter. Otherwise, click on the
"Continue" button to start the process of sending your letter.</p>

<p>Before WriteToThem.com sends the message, there is a simple fourth step. We
send you an email explaining that someone purporting to be you wants to send a
message to a named representative. <strong>This email will also contain a copy
of your letter</strong>, for you to keep as a reference. If the email cannot be
sent for whatever reason, the message will not be sent. If the email goes
unanswered, the message will not be sent. For these reasons, make sure you type
in your email address correctly on the form.</p>

<p>Your representative will be messaged only after you have visited a web
address (otherwise known as a "link" or "url") that we will send to you via
email. No need to write anything on the mail &mdash; just click on the link, or
copy and paste it in to your browser window and that's it. message sent.</p>

<p>If you would like a reply to your letter, don't forget to ask for one when
composing your message. It's up to the representative in question to get in
touch with you.</p>

<p>Two weeks after your message has been sent, we will email you again asking
if your representative has been in touch.  WriteToThem.com cannot be held
responsible for any representative's failure get in touch, but we think it
worthwhile to track their responsiveness.</p>

<p>WriteToThem.com would like to say again that while we are offering this site
as a service to the public, we can't guarantee to anyone that your
representative will read the message you send, and we have no way to follow up
any enquiries you make about your communication from your
representative.</p>

<dt><a name="address"></a>Why do you want my address, name, email address and phone?</dt>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Firstly to enable your representative to get in touch with you, and to
help the message that is sent look more like a formal letter.  Note that
entering your phone number is optional, but advisable, so
councillors can respond to your message by ringing you up.</li>
<li>Secondly, to enable us to send you a copy of your message for your
records, and to tell you if there was a delivery problem. </li>
<li>Thirdly, to enable you to confirm who you are.  WriteToThem.com is
concerned that this service is used in a responsible way by everyone.
Which is why we built it responsibly.  </li>
</ul>
<p class="toplink"><a href="#top">top</a></p>
</dd>


<dt><a name="onlyrep"></a>Why can't I write to any representative I like?</dt>

<dd>
<p>Representatives have a duty to listen and respond to the voters in
their areas of responsibility &mdash; but they can't possibly cope with regular
communication from the entire UK population.  We try to strike a balance
between getting people listened too, and not spamming elected officials.</p>

<p> We don't let anyone write to any representative &mdash; we try to encourage people to write to their own elected officials. If we let anyone write to anyone representative in the country, professional lobbyists would use us to blanket-message every one of the representatives, in the same way as
marketeers junk-mail as many people as they can. Parliament's telephone lines
would soon be melting from irrelevant spam. Eventually, representatives would ignore
<em>every</em> message, and the constituents who we try to put in contact with the only
person who can help them would get lost in the noise.</p>

<p class="toplink"><a href="#top">top</a></p>
</dd>

<dt><a name="formletters"></a>Why shouldn't I copy and paste "form" letters?</dt>

<dd>
<p>We know your issue is important to you, but we've spoken to representatives
&mdash; and if you are not a constituent, or you send a "copied and pasted"
form letter, your message will go straight into the bin.</p>

<p>If you're a pressure group, please think about what you're doing. If you
encourage all your members to write to the same representative, you will not show that representative 
the depth of support for your issue. You'll simply have used up a few sheets
of tax-funded message paper, and irritated an underpaid secretary or researcher.  And if you
encourage them all to send the same rote letter, representatives will just assume you
have a nasty little man with a photocopier blasting them out from your office,
and ignore you even more than they did before.</p>

<p>Still not convinced? Here's a quote from a Parliamentary researcher, whose job is to make 
the representative he/she works for as accessible as possible (such people are the hidden gems of our 
democracy):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>MPs rather naturally take a sudden influx of identical or similar messages
with a large pinch of salt, since they know that what they are seeing is stuff
from a minority of constituents who are either impassioned/neurotic about the
topic concerned or who are easily gulled into agreeing with some plausible
story and sending the message, since it takes minimum effort to do so.</p>

<p>Given a daily mailbag of (say) 50 individual messages from individual
constituents, on a wide range of topics, when the mailbag suddenly rises to 100
a day, 50 of which are much the same as each other, the representative has no
way at all of knowing whether the message concerned is representative of
opinion in the constituency.</p>

<p>All he or she knows is that 50 constituents have been persuaded to mail them
about 'topic X'. Much more notice is taken of trends within the regular flow of
messages from clearly identified constituents. If in a month 50 people write in
different ways and through different routes with similar views on a subject,
this is much more likely to raise the profile of the topic with the MP.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So please don't copy and paste the same message as everyone else. And don't
encourage others to do so. It's worse than useless. Ask people to write in
their own words. If they care enough about your issue, they'll do so.</p>

<dt><a name="whoareyou"></a>Who are you and why are you doing this?</dt>

<dd>
<p>This site has been built by
<a href="http://www.mysociety.org/">mySociety</a>, under the gracious guidance
of the original FaxYourMP.com team. mySociety has two missions. The first is to
be a charitable project which builds websites that have simple, tangible
benefits for individuals and groups in British society. The second is to
demonstrate to the public and voluntary sectors how thoughtful use of the
internet can lead to clear real-world results.</p>

<p>We are non-party-political, and our parent organisation is the registered
charity UK Citizens Online Democracy.</p>

<p>We have been fortunate enough to obtain funding from the
<a href="http://www.odpm.gov.uk/">Office of the Deputy Prime Minister</a>, in
partnership with <a href="http://www.westsussex.gov.uk">West Sussex County
Council</a>. The funding comes from something called their
<a href="http://www.odpm.gov.uk/pns/DisplayPN.cgi?pn_id=2004_0060">e-innovations
fund</a>.</p>

<p>FaxYourMP.com was a fully grassroots operation, which became
incorporated as FaxYourMP Ltd in order to exist legally.</p>

<p>Remember that it doesn't matter who you voted for personally, the representatives
who are elected for your area are duty bound to listen to your concerns. We
think that is a very important thing, and we want to help to promote their
ability to listen to you.</p>

<dt><a name="digitalsig"></a>There's a statement about signatures at the bottom
of my message. What's that about?</dt>

<dd>
<p>Way back in the early days of FaxYourMP.com, a small group of MPs started
replying to constituents who used the service, saying that they could not
possibly respond to unsigned messages. Because FaxYourMP messages weren't
signed, the MPs couldn't be sure that they were genuine. The constituents were
asked to resubmit their request on paper.</p>

<p>This was a bit confusing to the FaxYourMP team. In practical terms, a
written signature proves nothing: in order to check the veracity of the letter
or signature, you'd have to check it with the original author to get a
confirmatory sample of their signature &mdash; and if you were doing that, why didn't
you just <em>ask</em> them about the letter?  It made no sense.</p>

<p>Then they thought: aha, perhaps this is some <em>legal</em> requirement.  A
lot of MPs are lawyers, and are probably very good about this kind of thing.
Perhaps even better than they are at simply answering constituents'
requests.</p>

<p>Happily, if it's legality they're worried about, there is a fix.  The
<a href="http://www.hmso.gov.uk/acts/acts2000/20000007.htm#7">Electronic
Communications Act 2000, Subsection 7(3)</a> states:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>7(3) For the purposes of this section an electronic signature incorporated
into or associated with a particular electronic communication or particular
electronic data is certified by any person if that person (whether before or
after the making of the communication) has made a statement confirming
that--</p>

<p>(a) the signature,</p>
<p>(b) a means of producing, communicating or verifying the signature, or</p>
<p>(c) a procedure applied to the signature,</p>

<p>is (either alone or in combination with other factors) a valid means of
establishing the authenticity of the communication or data, the integrity of
the communication or data, or both.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The message at the bottom of your message is your statement to that effect.
For the purpose of sending a letter to your representative, your electronic
signature is legally valid. You may point this out to your representative
should they tell you that they can't reply to your message, because they don't
know who you are.</p>

<p>And what does the strange '0c0c38720cde084343' bit signify?</p>

<p>It's an SHA1 hash of your e-mail address. Very impressive to overly
legalistic MPs. Highly technical.</p>

<p class="toplink"><a href="#top">top</a></p>
</dd>

<dt><a name="checkmessage"></a>Can I check the message before I send it?</dt>

<dd>
<p>Yes. There is every chance to take a second look and make sure you said what 
you wanted to say. Just click on "Preview" before you send the message, and you 
can see the whole thing nicely formatted.</p>

<p>Check through it, and if you see anything you don't like, just click
on<br><b>"&lt;&lt;edit this Message"</b>.</p>

<p>It will take you straight back to the form, where you will be able to delete
or add anything you want. There is no limit to the amount of times you can
preview and edit.</p>

<p class="toplink"><a href="#top">top</a></p>
</dd>

<dt><a name="howsitsent"></a>How is it sent to all the councillors and members?</dt>

<dd>
<p>Most messages are sent directly to representatives' official email
addresses. However, we can also fax messages to those representatives who do
not yet have public email addresses. Furthermore, we may fax messages to
representatives who do not appear to be actively checking their email. Many
representatives have paper-based filing systems, and find it much easier to
deal with faxed messages than emails.</p>

<p>For most local councillors we will send your message to their council, who
will forward it to them. There are more than twenty thousand councillors in the
UK, and keeping track of all of their addresses individually would be very hard
work! This way is easier and works just as well.</p>

<p class="toplink"><a href="#top">top</a></p>
</dd>

<dt><a name="guarantee"></a>Can you guarantee my message will be sent?</dt>

<dd>
<p>Sadly, no. We have more than 24,000 representives in our database, and
whilst <a href="http://www.goveval.com">GovEval</a> help us keep them up to
date, there will be some that fall through the gap. We will do everything we
can to spot and eliminate problems though, so please let us know if you have
spotted any gaps. We will, however, do everything we can to tell you if your
message didn't get through.</p>

</dd>

<dt><a name="doityourself"></a>I have an idea for a service similar to WriteToThem.com. How would I set it up? Can I use your software?</dt>

<dd>
<p>Our software is all available on our public CVS and you can use it under the
terms of the Affero GPL "Open Source" licence. There's a link in the copyright
messages at the bottom of every page. Sadly, we have to keep licensed data
(such as the links between postcodes and wards/constituencies, and the names of
representatives) out of the public domain, but there is a huge amount of useful
work available here, especially for people who want to build versions of
WriteToThem.com in other countries.</p>

<p>Feel free to ask our developers about how the service works! Their email
addresses are in every source file. They'll do their best to answer your
questions, within reason.</p>

<p>Then we really want to hear from you.</p>

<p>Whilst we offer this service for free, we still want it to work. Don't
hesitate to mail us at the following email address to let us know if
anything strange happens (while you use the site, not in life
generally), you see any error messages or simply if you want to get in
