<h3>Your message is near-identical to others sent previously</h3>

<p>Sorry, but please read <a href="/about-qa#formletters">this</a> to understand why sending identikit "copied and pasted" messages is detrimental to your campaign.</p>


<p>Sorry to be so harsh, but representatives have made it clear that the
receipt of such fax "spam" could mean they bin <strong>all</strong> messages
sent via WriteToThem.com.</p>
<p>Which would be  A Bad Thing.</p>
<p>You might like to let the person who asked you to do this that they've
potentially sabotaged their own campaign too. Perhaps you might ask them to
read the <a href="/about-guidelines">instructions</a> on the site next time?</p>

<p>
If you wish to send a message, use the "back" button in your browser or click
<a href="javascript:history.back();">here</a> and write it in your own,
original, words.
</p>
