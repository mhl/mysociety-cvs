<? if ($values['year'] == '2005') { ?>
    <p>Between 2001 and 2004 our predecessor FaxYourMP.com published a league
    table of MP responsiveness data, measuring
    the proportion of users who said that they had heard something back
    from their MP after they had written to them.</p>
    <p>In 2005 <a href="http://www.mysociety.org/">mySociety</a> held off publishing an updated version of this data
    because we were busy totally rebuilding FaxYourMP as <a href="/">WriteToThem</a>,
    adding all the UK's 20,000+ other elected representatives, such as
    councillors and MSPs.</p>
    <p>We are now publishing this data to celebrate WriteToThem's first
    birthday, and to fulfil our parent charity's registered objects &mdash; to
    conduct research into the interaction between elected bodies and the
    Internet.</p>

    <h3><a name="responsehistogram">Did MPs do better this year or last year?</a></h3>

    <p>Overall, according to our users' survey responses, MPs were 2% less
    responsive to constituents' messages sent via WriteToThem in 2006 compared to in
    2005. This is partly because of a sharp drop in the number of MPs getting those
    near-perfect scores of 90% or higher responsiveness. On the other hand,
    far fewer MPs have woeful response rates less than 20%.

    <h3><a name="deprivation">Do only the better off use WriteToThem?</a></h3>

    <p>Sometimes people have told us that websites like WriteToThem only help
    people who are already better off in society, because they have better access
    to computers.  One of our volunteers, Sam Smith, has tested this and found that
    people from deprived areas use WriteToThem as much or more than people
    from better off areas. You can read his full paper on the subject here. </p>

    <h3><a name="responsehistogram">Did MPs do better this year or last year?</a></h3>

    <p>Overall, according to our users' survey responses, MPs were 1% less
    responsive to constituents' messages sent via WriteToThem in 2007 compared to in
    2006. Once again MPs have moved to the middle - there are slightly fewer MPs with dire
    response rates (below 20%) and also fewer with tip top scores
    (above 80%). Unfortunately, the now fatter bump in the middle has
    shifted leftwards a bit, meaning more MPs are scoring below 50% than last
    year.
