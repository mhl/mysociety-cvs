<p>Please <strong>*ONLY*</strong> use this service to fax Tony Blair if you are one of his
<strong>constituents</strong> in Sedgefield. Many people from outside of Mr

constituency office via WriteToThem.com</p>

<p>If you NOT a constituent of Sedgefield and wish to contact Tony Blair, you
may write to him at the address below:<p>

The Rt Hon Tony Blair <br>
