<h1>Thanks for your feedback... and one *last* question</h1>

<p>Oh dear... that's not so good.</p>

<p>We're very grateful for your feedback, although we're as disappointed
as you must be that your representative has not responded &mdash; sometimes
they have good reason, sometimes not. Very occasionally, it is our fault
for having your representative's contact details wrong.</p>

<? if ($values['recipient_type'] == 'WMC') { ?>
<p>It is worth trying to contact your MP by other means. For example, <strong>call
their local office</strong> and arrange a session at their "surgery". These are a chance
to meet your MP face to face and raise your issue with them. 
Look up the number in your local telephone directory, or try <a
href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=<?=urlencode($values['recipient_name'])?>">Googling
for <?=$values['recipient_name']?></a>.
</p>
<? } else { ?>
<p>It is worth trying to contact your representative by other means. Look up
their telephone number or postal address. 
<a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=<?=urlencode($values['recipient_name'])?>">Google 
search for <?=$values['recipient_name']?></a> to do this.
If you like, ask to meet up with them in person; most representatives have
"surgeries".
</p>
<? } ?>

<p>One last, *last* question (we promise...)</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Is this the first time you've ever contacted one of your
political representatives, by any means? &nbsp; 
<a href=<?=$values['first_time_yes']?>>YES</a> / <a
href=<?=$values['first_time_no']?>>NO</a></b>
</ul>

<p>Why are we being so nosey? Well, one of our aims is to convince
politicians that, used wisely, the Web can encourage much greater
participation in the democratic process.

<p>Thanks again for your feedback.</p>
