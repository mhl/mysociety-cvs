<h1>Thanks for your feedback... and one *last* question</h1>

<p>We hope your representative gets back to you with a full answer soon.

<? if ($values['recipient_type'] == 'WMC') { ?>
<p>If they don't, it is worth trying to contact your MP by other means. For
example, <strong>call their local office</strong> and arrange a session at
their "surgery". These are a chance to meet your MP face to face and raise your
issue with them.  Look up the number in your local telephone directory, or try
<a
href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=<?=urlencode($values['recipient_name'])?>">Googling
for <?=$values['recipient_name']?></a>.
</p>
<? } else { ?>
<p>If they don't, it is worth trying to contact your representative by other means. Look up
their telephone number or postal address. 
<a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=<?=urlencode($values['recipient_name'])?>">Google 
search for <?=$values['recipient_name']?></a> to do this.
If you like, ask to meet up with them in person; most representatives have
"surgeries".
</p>
<? } ?>

<p>One last, *last* question (we promise...)</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Is this the first time you've ever contacted one of your
political representatives, by any means? &nbsp; 
<a href=<?=$values['first_time_yes']?>>YES</a> / <a
href=<?=$values['first_time_no']?>>NO</a></b>
</ul>

<p>Why are we being so nosey? Well, one of our aims is to convince
politicians that, used wisely, the Web can encourage much greater
participation in the democratic process.

<p>Thanks again for your feedback.</p>
