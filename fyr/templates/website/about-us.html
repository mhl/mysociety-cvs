<p>The predecessor to this site, <b>FaxYourMP.com</b>, was built by a
group of volunteers who thought that it would be a good thing if it were easier
for people to contact their MPs.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.mysociety.org/">mySociety</a> is a charitable
organisation which has grown out of this community of volunteers. mySociety's
primary mission is to build internet projects which give people simple,
tangible benefits in the civic and community aspects of their lives. Our first
project was to take FaxYourMP and rebuild it bigger and better. This is the
FaxYourMP ethic, and mySociety's job is to extend it via a series of new sites.
<a href="http://www.writetothem.com/">WriteToThem</a> was the first <a href="http://www.mysociety.org/moin.cgi/LaunchProjects">launch project</a> to be finished, in 2005</p>

<p><a href="http://www.mysociety.org/index.php?p=3">We have funding to do this</a> from the
<a href="http://www.odpm.gov.uk">Office of the Deputy Prime Minister</a>'s
e-innovations fund, in partnership with
<a href="http://www.westsussex.gov.uk">West Sussex County Council</a>. Many
thanks to them.</p>

<p>Like all mySociety projects, <b>WriteToThem</b> combines the work of some
core developers, who are paid to keep working even when everyone else gets
bored, and volunteers. Here is the list of everyone who's helped build
