<?=$values['weeks_ago']?> weeks ago we sent your letter to <?=$values['recipient_name']?>, your
<?=$values['recipient_position']?>. (For reference, there's a copy of your
letter at the bottom of this email)

- If you HAVE had a reply (not just an acknowledgement), please
click on the link below:

    <?=$values['yes_url']?>

- If you HAVE NOT had a reply, or you have only had an acknowledgement, please
click on the link below:

    <?=$values['no_url']?>

If you feel that neither link is suitable, then please do not answer the
questionnaire.

Your feedback will allow us to publish performance tables of the responsiveness
of all the politicians in the UK. The majority of
<?=$values['recipient_position_plural']?> respond promptly and diligently to the
needs and views of <?=$values['their_constituents']?>. They deserve credit and
respect for their conscientiousness.

Likewise, we're keen to expose the minority of
<?=$values['recipient_position_plural']?> who don't seem to give a damn.

The letter you sent to your <?=$values['recipient_position']?> will be deleted
from our database within the next two weeks. Our full privacy policy can be read here:
