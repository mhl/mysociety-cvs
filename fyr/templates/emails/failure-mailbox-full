We're very sorry, but it wasn't possible to send your letter to
<?=$values['recipient_name']?>, your <?=$values['recipient_position']?>.

We tried for a week, but it appears that their mailbox was full and so your
message to them bounced back to us.

We've attached a copy of your letter to the bottom of this email, so that
you can print it out and send it by more traditional means. Or, try again
via our site in a week or so -- hopefully they'll have cleared out some of
their backlog by then.

Please do not reply to this mail. If you have a question or comment about the
site, please send an email to team@writetothem.com
