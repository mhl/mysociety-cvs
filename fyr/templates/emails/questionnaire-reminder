Three weeks ago we sent your letter to <?=$values['recipient_name']?>, your
<?=$values['recipient_position']?>. (For reference, there's a copy of your
letter at the bottom of this email)

- If you HAVE had a real reply (not an automatic emailed acknowledgement or a
'please wait' note on paper), please click on the link below:

    <?=$values['yes_url']?>

- If you HAVE NOT had a reply, or you have only had a holding message, please
click on the link below:

Unlike most other workers in the public sector, the performance of
<?=$values['recipient_position_plural']?> is not measured and published. With
your help, we'd like to fix this curious anomaly.

Your feedback will allow us to publish performance tables of the responsiveness
of all the politicians in the UK. The majority of
<?=$values['recipient_position_plural']?> respond promptly and diligently to the
needs and views of their constituents. They deserve credit and respect for
their conscientiousness.

Likewise, we're keen to expose the minority of
<?=$values['recipient_position_plural']?> who don't seem to give a damn.

Rest assured that we will not store ANY data that could be used to identify
you. We do not keep a copy of the letter you sent to your
<?=$values['recipient_position']?>.
