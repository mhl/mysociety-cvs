Emails sent to constituents by the queue. For consistency we interpret these
and interpret variables like

    <?=$values['name_of_variable']?>

(the superficial similarity to PHP is intentional) but that is the ONLY syntax
supported.

Values which are available in all emails are:

  - recipient_name, the name of the representative to whom the original letter
    was addressed, e.g. "Tony Blair";

  - recipient_position, their position, e.g. "MP";

  - recipient_position_plural, plural form of position, e.g. "MPs"; and

  - sender_name, the full name of the sender as they supplied it.

The text of each message should be formatted with blank lines between
paragraphs; all text will be filled/wrapped to an appropriate width before
sending.

Emails and the available variables are:

  - confirm
  - confirm-reminder

    Sent to the user to ask them to confirm their email address. Extra variables
    are,

      - confirm_url, the URL which they should click to confirm their address.

    -reminder is the reminder mail, sent one day after the original.

    The text of the constituent's letter is appended to the confirmation mail.

  - failure

    Sent to the user if delivery of their letter failed. No extra variables.
    
    The text of the constituent's letter is appended to the failure notice.

  - questionnaire
  - questionnaire-reminder

    Sent to the user two weeks after their letter is sent, to ask them whether
    they have had a reply from their representative. Extra variables are,

      - yes_url, the URL they should click to indicate that they have received
        a reply; and

      - no_url, the URL they should click to indicate that they have not
        received a reply.
    
    -reminder is the reminder mail, send one week after the original.
