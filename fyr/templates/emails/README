Emails sent to constituents by the queue. For consistency we interpret these
and interpret variables like

    <?=$values['name_of_variable']?>

(the superficial similarity to PHP is intentional) but that is the ONLY syntax
supported.

Values which are available in all emails are:

  - recipient_name, the name of the representative to whom the original letter
    was addressed, e.g. "Tony Blair";

  - recipient_position, their position, e.g. "MP";

  - recipient_position_plural, plural form of position, e.g. "MPs";

  - recipient_area_name, their voting area, e.g. "Sedgefield";

  - recipient_id, the ID of the recipient;

  - sender_name, the full name of the sender as they supplied it; and

  - sender_addr, the sender's address, formatted with commas between each line.

The text of each message should be formatted with blank lines between
paragraphs; all text will be filled/wrapped to an appropriate width before
sending.

Emails and the available variables are:

  - confirm
  - confirm-reminder

    Sent to the user to ask them to confirm their email address. Extra variables
    are,

      - confirm_url, the URL which they should click to confirm their address.

    -reminder is the reminder mail, sent one day after the original.

    The text of the constituent's letter is appended to the confirmation mail.

        the email etc.

    The text of the constituent's letter is appended to the failure notice.

  - questionnaire

    they have had a reply from their representative. Extra variables are,

        a reply; and

      - no_url, the URL they should click to indicate that they have not
