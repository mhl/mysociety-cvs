Subject: Empty property report

Dear Empty Property Officer,

This is a new referral of an empty property in your area made by a user of the
website ReportEmptyHomes.com; the website user has been told that the case has
been referred to you.  We would be grateful if you could do whatever you can to
help get this property back into use. We will contact the user in a month and
again in six months and ask them what has happened to the property.  

We'd encourage you to tell us what you have done, and when the property comes
back into use, by filling in an update against the property referral on the
website:

    <?=$values['url']?>

This gives useful feedback to website users and helps them understand what
action you are taking. We will offer advice to the user on other action they
might take if the property isn't successfully dealt with.  

<?=$values['has_photo']?>If you would like help or advice on getting empty properties back into use
there is lots of useful information on the Empty Homes Agency's website
www.EmptyHomes.com - if you have further questions please give us a call.
