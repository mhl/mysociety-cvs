<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
    <dl>
        <dt>What is FixMyStreet?</dt>
        <dd>FixMyStreet is a site to help people report, view,
or discuss local problems they&rsquo;ve found to their local council by
simply locating them on a map. It launched in early February
2007.</dd>
        <dt>What sort of problems should I report with FixMyStreet?</dt>
        <dd>FixMyStreet is primarily for reporting things which are
<strong>broken or dirty or damaged or dumped, and need fixing, cleaning
or clearing</strong>, such as:

    <ul><li>Abandoned vehicles
    <li>Dog Fouling
    <li>Flyposting or graffiti
    <li>Flytipping or litter
    <li>Streetcleaning, such as broken glass in a cycle lane
    <li>Unlit lamposts
    <li>Potholes
    </ul>
    </dd>

    <dt>What isn’t FixMyStreet for?</dt>
    <dd>FixMyStreet is not a way of getting in touch with your council for all
    issues – please use FixMyStreet only for problems such as the above. We
    often route problem reports via cleansing services or highways and so using
    FixMyStreet for other matters may result in a delay in your report getting
    to the right department. <strong>You will need to contact your council
    directly for problems such as</strong>: 

    <ul><li>Anti-social behaviour

    <li>Noise pollution or barking dogs
    <li>Missing wheelie bins or recycling boxes or missed rubbish collections
    <li>Proposals for speed bumps/ CCTV/ pedestrian crossings/ new road layouts/ etc.
    <li>Complaining about your neighbours
    <li>Complaining about the council
    <li>Joy riding, drug taking, animal cruelty, or other criminal activity
    </ul>
    <p>Councils often have direct hotlines for these sorts of issues.</p>
    </dd>

        <dt>How do I use the site?</dt>
        <dd>After entering a postcode or location, you are presented
with a map of that area. You can view problems already reported in that area,
or report ones of your own simply by clicking on the map at the location of
the problem.</dd>
        <dt>How are the problems solved?</dt>
        <dd>They are reported to the relevant council by email. The
council can then resolve the problem the way they normally would.
Alternatively, you can discuss the problem on the website with others, and
then together lobby the council to fix it, or fix it directly yourselves.</dd>
        <dt>Is it free?</dt>
        <dd>The site is free to use, yes. FixMyStreet is run
by a registered charity, though, so if you want to make a contribution, <a
href="https://secure.mysociety.org/donate/">please do</a>.</dd>
    <dt>Why do you only cover the countries of Great Britain?</dt>
    <dd>We would love to cover Northern Ireland, but as we were funded for
    FixMyStreet by the Department for Constitutional Affairs (now the Ministry
    of Justice), we were covered for Ordnance Survey data (but not OSNI data)
    by the Pan-Governmental Agreement. The cost for these maps would be
    prohibitively expensive for the small charity that we are &ndash; if you know of
    any way we could get access to the Ordnance Survey for Northern Ireland's
    maps so that we can add them to the site, that'd be great.</dd>
    </dl>

    <h2>Practical Questions</h2>
    <dl>
        <dt>I&rsquo;m from a council, where do you send the reports?</dt>
        <dd>You can either leave a test report or <a href="/contact">contact us</a>
to find out where reports go at the moment. Also <a href="/contact">contact us</a>
to update the address or addresses we use.</dd>
        <dt>Do you remove silly or illegal content?</dt>
        <dd>FixMyStreet is not responsible for the content and accuracy
of material submitted by its users. We reserve the right to edit or remove any
problems or updates which we consider to be inappropriate upon being informed
by a user of the site.</dd>
    <dt>Why does the site use kilometres for measurements?</dt>
    <dd>Thanks for asking politely &ndash; we never quite understand why some of the rudest
    emails we receive are on this topic. The British national
    grid reference system, devised by Ordnance Survey (the British national
    mapping agency) around the time of the second world war, uses eastings and
    northings measured in metres and kilometres; the maps we use are from
    Ordnance Survey and so this is what we use to display distances.
    There you have it: not everything British is in miles!</dd>

        <dt>Why doesn&rsquo;t dragging the map work on reporting-a-problem pages in Safari or Konqueror?</dt>
        <dd>There&rsquo;s a bug in these two browsers to do with setting images on form
submit buttons, which the map uses when reporting a problem. It&rsquo;s fixed in the
latest nightly build of Safari, so will presumably be fixed in the next
release. Until then, I&rsquo;ve sadly had to disable dragging to avoid people
dragging an empty square.</dd>
    <dt>Why isn’t there a zoom button on the map?</dt>
    <dd>There isn’t a zoom on the map as we want to keep things very local;
    this might mean that you’ll need to pan around to figure out where the
    problem is if you’re not familiar with the area. If you’re from the
    council then the emailed version of the problem report will contain the
    closest postal address to the pin on the map.</dd>

    <dt>This site is great – why aren’t you better publicised?</dt>
    <dd>As a tiny charity we simply don’t have a publicity budget, and we
    rely on word of mouth to advertise the site. We have a whole <a
    href="posters/">array of posters, flyers and badges</a> if you’d like
    to publicise us on the web or in your local area, and why not write to your
    local paper to let them know about us?</dd> </dl>

    <h2>Privacy Questions</h2>
    <dl>
        <dt>Who gets to see my email address?</dt>
        <dd>If you submit a problem, we pass on your details, and details
of the problem, to the council contact or contacts responsible for the
area where you located the problem. Your name is displayed upon the
site if you let us, but not your email address; similarly with updates.  We will
never give or sell your email address to anyone else, unless we are
obliged to by law.</dd>
        <dt>Will you send nasty, brutish spam to my email address?</dt>
        <dd>Never. We will email you if someone leaves an update on a
problem you&rsquo;ve reported, and send you a questionnaire email four weeks
after you submit a problem, asking for a status update; we&rsquo;ll only ever
send you emails in relation to your problem.</dd>
    </dl>
    <h2>Organisation Questions</h2>
    <dl>
        <dt>Who built FixMyStreet?</dt>
        <dd>This site was built by <a href="http://www.mysociety.org/">mySociety</a>, in conjunction with the <a href="http://www.youngfoundation.org.uk/">Young Foundation</a>. 
mySociety is the project of a registered charity which has grown out of the community of
volunteers who built sites like <a href="http://www.theyworkforyou.com/">TheyWorkForYou.com</a>. 
mySociety&rsquo;s primary mission is to build Internet projects which give people simple, tangible
benefits in the civic and community aspects of their lives. Our first project
was <a href="http://www.writetothem.com/">WriteToThem</a>, where you can write to any of your
elected representatives, for free.</dd>
        <dt><img src="/i/moj.png" align="right" alt="Ministry of Justice" hspace="10">Who pays for it?</dt>
        <dd>FixMyStreet was paid for via the Department for
Constitutional Affairs Innovations Fund.</dd>
        <dt><a name="nfi"></a>Wasn&rsquo;t this site called Neighbourhood Fix-It?</dt>
        <dd>Yes, we changed the name mid June 2007. We decided
Neighbourhood Fix-It was a bit of a mouthful, hard to spell, and hard to publicise (does the URL have a dash in it or not?). The domain FixMyStreet became available, and everyone liked the name.</dd>
        <dt>Do you need any help with the project?</dt>
        <dd>Yes, we can use help in all sorts of ways, technical or
non-technical.  Please see our <a
href="http://www.mysociety.org/helpus/">Get Involved page</a>.</dd>
        <dt>Where&rsquo;s the "source code" to this site?</dt>
        <dd>The software behind this site is open source, and available
to you mainly under the GNU Affero GPL software license. You can <a
href="https://secure.mysociety.org/cvstrac/dir?d=mysociety">download the
source code</a> (look under &lsquo;bci&rsquo;) and help us develop it.
You&rsquo;re welcome to use it in your own projects, although you must also
make available the source code to any such projects.</dd>
        <dt>People build things, not organisations. Who <em>actually</em> built it?</dt>
        <dd>Matthew Somerville and Francis Irving wrote the site,
Chris Lightfoot wrote the tileserver and map cutter, Richard Pope created
our pins, Deborah Kerr keeps things up-to-date and does user support,
Ayesha Garrett designed our posters, and Tom Steinberg managed it all.
