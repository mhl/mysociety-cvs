FixMyStreet iPhone application
==============================

The FixMyStreet directory contains a complete application that should open
directly in XCode.

TODO (if you're an iPhone or Perl developer and wish to help mySociety,
----      feel free to volunteer for any of these)

* When you go to the About page from the front page, the navigation bar flips
  as well as the page. For perfection, it probably shouldn't, but every time I
  tried (presumably with a parent controller controlling the main view and the
  about view), I failed, and it's not really /that/ important. :-)

* Do the photos have EXIF data (e.g. location)? Should we use that if so in some way?

* Photo orientation - either auto-working it out from EXIF data/ anything else
  provided, or letting the user rotate the submitted photo.
