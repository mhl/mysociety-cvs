Work out how to get it to tell you code coverage of .rhtml files

Tidy up error message text (like "body must be filled in") on info request form

Call "delete from sessions where now() - updated_at > 3600" (one hour) or whatever

Do pretty error messages, e.g. on invalid public body name page etc.

404s on all invalid URL parameters
Hook global error message also

Legal/privacy
=============

Check act to see if can use pseudonym for FOI request?
"We will not reveal your email address to anybody" - are there circumstances
 (e.g. somebody messaging creator of a request and it bouncing) where we
 may reasonably do this, and should say it may happen?

Maybe we SHOULD reveal their email to the public body, why not?

Say that we would like response by email (not postal address) in footer

Later

(10:32:14) richard: you just need to count the number of rows of text and compare it to the number of rows in the textbox
(10:32:29) richard: then increase the height of the textbox by 1em-ish
(10:32:52) Matthew: their function is called autogrow_textarea() by the way, if you just want to look at it...
 thanks :) I won't do it now as there are more important things, I was just accidentally impressed

Check FOE site lots
http://community.foe.co.uk/tools/right_to_know/request_generator.html

Look at this basic US site

Add spelling checker as in WTT

For grey hints in input fields
http://pauldowman.com/projects/fieldhints/

Somehow validate all pages with HTML validate

Consider having link to publications scheme type pages for each body:
http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/oswebsite/aboutus/foi/index.html
http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/oswebsite/aboutus/foi/coiindex.html

Maybe prepend letter for them with "this is FOI request blah" boilerplate?
