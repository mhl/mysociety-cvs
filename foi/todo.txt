FOI requests to use to test it
==============================

Please send me all documentation relating to the decision to use results from
the Oxford Economic Forecasting's report "The Economic Contribution of the
Aviation Industry in the UK" in the "Air Transport White Paper Progress Report
 2006"

BAILII - relationship with law courts, robots.txt ?

"Fundamental Savings Review" - Tom's friend


Status of messages stuff
========================

Status inputting:
    cope with "other" case when something is both (e.g. received some AND clarify)

Alert somewhere if working days table not up to date

Adam's woes:
http://foi.mysociety.org/request/18/response/31
- Renders badly
- No doubt leaks email address via download.bin :(
- We don't have "this is an evil techy weird bounce" as option for state of message

And Tom's woes:
    http://foi.mysociety.org/request/8
Add - response was made in private state
    or maybe 'response refusing to publish for spurious reasons
Also: Consider removing login links from notifications of new responses

Do something at least a bit aggressive when response is late

Go through all requests and check status is shiny

Next
====

Rename frontpage controller to home (or home to frontpage)

Put the admin "Public page" link on request page somewhere clearer

Lucene for search - use http://acts-as-solr.rubyforge.org/
Have a look at http://swish-e.org/
Or polish up an acts_as_xapian

Sort the requests by when something last happened to them (this needs thought as to what
sort orders we need)
Sort by due date

Fix the fastcgi errors
[Mon Jan 21 10:38:45 2008] [error] [client 81.107.40.81] FastCGI: incomplete headers (0 bytes) rec
eived from server "/data/vhost/foi.mysociety.org/docs/dispatch.fcgi"

Later
=====

Consider on staging sites making follow ups go to dummy address also

Make the email address for responses 
    - something bland for domain name
    - perhaps put name of user in the part before the @ ?

(10:32:14) richard: you just need to count the number of rows of text and compare it to the number of rows in the textbox
(10:32:29) richard: then increase the height of the textbox by 1em-ish
(10:32:52) Matthew: their function is called autogrow_textarea() by the way, if you just want to look at it...

Way of contacting other users
    "We will not reveal your email address to anybody" - are there circumstances
     (e.g. somebody messaging creator of a request and it bouncing) where we
     may reasonably do this, and should say it may happen?
     -- I think this is fine EXCEPT for the facility to send messages. Do we have
     fake hash addresses two way for each user for the message-to-user sending
     thing? Would make sense.

Properly escape all name_and_email functions
