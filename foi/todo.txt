FOI requests to use to test it
==============================

The Better Regulation Executive has issued step–by–step guidance for officials
wishing to use the order–making powers to deliver regulatory reform. For this
and contact details for the guidance, please visit the Better Regulation Unit
Intranet site [NB:This site is only available for Government departments].
http://bre.berr.gov.uk/regulation/reform/bill/index.asp

Please send me all documentation relating to the decision to use results from
the Oxford Economic Forecasting's report "The Economic Contribution of the
Aviation Industry in the UK" in the "Air Transport White Paper Progress Report
 2006"

States
======

What I *really* care about is the state of the request for use in the
user interface, e.g. search results, RSS feeds.

- Awaiting response
- Response overdue
- Awaiting follow up information / clarification from requester
  (same as awaiting categorisation from requester?)
- Responses contain no useful information XXX exact wording matters
- Responses contain some useful information (XXX RSS needs to know when more)
- Response contains all information requested

State to ask about individual messages

Please choose what this response is.
    a) an acknowledgement of message received / forwarded on
    b) asking for clarification about your request
    c) a response containing information
    e) a rejection notice

Brainstorm of things to say if c):

    How satisfied are you that your original request has been answered?
        a) Quite satisfied, they've sent most of the information, or equivalent information.
        b) Neutral, they sent some useful information, but not all.
        c) Dissatisfied, they didn't send the relevant information.

    How much of the information you originally requested have you recieved?
        a) All of it.
        b) Some of it.
        c) None of it.

    Have you now got all the info you originally requested
        a) Yes, pretty well.
        b) No

    Are you yet satisfied that your original request has been answered?
        a) Yes, I now have (most) of the information I wanted from my original request.
        b) I received some of the information, or some related useful information.
        c) I have received
        d) My request was explicitly rejected


Status of messages stuff
========================

Followups:
    - link to the follow up form, or embed in bottom of main request page
    - don't show classify link on /response/ page

Use sent again date when there has been resent?, e.g. for
    http://foi.mysociety.org/request/16

Show due date on, e.g.
    http://foi.mysociety.org/request/4
Sort by due date, show categorisation everywhere
Alert somewhere if working days table not up to date

Sort the requests by when something last happened to them (this needs thought as to what
sort orders we need)

Make sure this page is OK
http://foi.mysociety.org/request/14

Tidying
=======

Work out how to get it to tell you code coverage of .rhtml files
Make it validate the HTML
    maybe with http://www.anodyne.ca/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/be_valid_xhtml.rb
Test that it is actually sending the request outgoing mail, by using deliveries
Add fixtures for info_request_event
Test sending a message to bounce/envelope-from address

Link internally between different bits of admin interface

Add SQL database indexes to token / email_token in post_redirects

Set "null" and "default" options more in schema
Add SQL foreign keys to database schema (THIS IS IMPORTANT, or things will screw up)
    execute 'ALTER TABLE researchers ADD CONSTRAINT fk_researchers_departments FOREIGN KEY ( department_id ) REFERENCES departments( id ) '

Call "delete from sessions where now() - updated_at > 3600" (one hour) or whatever

Mark some requests as test requests

Check act to see if can use pseudonym for FOI request?

Make it so if the pipe fails, exim tries again rather than sending an error to the public body.
    Or so errors go to an admin somehow, at the very least.

Screen scrape this and add link to it on the public body page

(10:32:14) richard: you just need to count the number of rows of text and compare it to the number of rows in the textbox
(10:32:29) richard: then increase the height of the textbox by 1em-ish
(10:32:52) Matthew: their function is called autogrow_textarea() by the way, if you just want to look at it...
 thanks :) I won't do it now as there are more important things, I was just accidentally impressed

Lucene for search (ask Louise for plugin)
Have a look at http://swish-e.org/

Generic alerting/tracking system including
    - email alerts and RSS
    - new requests, new good responses etc.
    

Read wiki page lots
http://www.mysociety.org/moin.cgi/FreedomOfInformation
And comments on proposal
http://www.mysociety.org/2006/04/04/freedom-of-information-archive/

Check FOE site lots
http://community.foe.co.uk/tools/right_to_know/request_generator.html

Look at this basic US site
http://www.rcfp.org/foi_letter/generate.php

This is interesting
http://www.liverpool.gov.uk/Council_government_and_democracy/About_your_council/Data_protection_and_FOI/FOI/Suppliers_and_Contractors/index.asp

Add spelling checker as in WTT

For grey hints in input fields

Somehow validate all pages with HTML validate

Consider having link to publications scheme type pages for each body:
http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/oswebsite/aboutus/foi/index.html
http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/oswebsite/aboutus/foi/coiindex.html

Maybe prepend letter for them with "this is FOI request blah" boilerplate?

Way of contacting other users
    "We will not reveal your email address to anybody" - are there circumstances
     (e.g. somebody messaging creator of a request and it bouncing) where we
     may reasonably do this, and should say it may happen?
     -- I think this is fine EXCEPT for the facility to send messages. Do we have
     fake hash addresses two way for each user for the message-to-user sending
     thing? Would make sense.

Properly escape all name_and_email functions

Give hotline to call body for extra help
Advice and assistance in making FoI requests to the House of Lords is available
from the Freedom of Information Officer, Parliamentary Archives, House of
Lords. London SW1A 0PW. Telephone 020 7219 0100. E-mail: foilords@parliament.uk
http://www.parliament.uk/parliamentary_publications_and_archives/freedom_of_information_in_the_house_of_lords/lords__foi___how_to_obtain_information.cfm

Including 'Request for information' in the subject line of your e-mail will assist us in prioritising your request.
http://www.parliament.uk/parliamentary_publications_and_archives/freedom_of_information_in_the_house_of_lords/lords__foi___how_to_obtain_information.cfm

Consider putting the requesting user's name in the request's magic email address

Escape "www.liverpool.gov.uk <http://www.liverpool.gov.uk>" properly - so it doesn't catch
the last > converted to &gt; too badly
    http://localhost:3000/request/5?
(and be sure if you use a hack with a secret, it really is secret to stop people making evil links)

Check log rotation is working well

Sources of public bodies

Send to MoD seems to require a form

Heather has some for central departments
