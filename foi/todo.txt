[12:11:25] â€¦ To Liverpool City Council:

Please send me a copy of the contract signed with Veolia for refuse and recycling collection.

Next
====

Either rotate log files, or merge with Apache ones

Check confirmed everywhere in password check etc.

Rename classify to /request/single_response or something?

Send email to requestor telling them new information has come in
Let them send follow-ups
Do something after 20 working days if you get no response

Forgotten password link
Email has already been taken hasn't got a way to sign in
Link from error page for signin/signup to go to other one
Remember me box

Work out how to get it to tell you code coverage of .rhtml files
Make it validate the HTML
    maybe with http://www.anodyne.ca/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/be_valid_xhtml.rb
Check we call integrate_views for all controllers
Test that actually sending request outgoing mail using deliveries

Remove "Outgoing messages is invalid" error

You need to pull the magic email addresses out of incoming_messages so they
aren't shown on the website

Some way of getting to your own user page
 
Tidying
=======

Do we need to say to the public body "all responses will be published" from a
privacy point of view?

accept-charset="utf-8" on all forms - does it matter if Content-Type of whole
page is already UTF-8?

Use working days

Bubbles don't validate
http://localhost:3000/request/5

Add SQL database indexes to token / email_token in post_redirects

Prevent double posting of same request

If summary is blank, says "title must be filled in" grrrr
Tidy up error message text (like "body must be filled in") on info request form

Set "null" and "default" options more in schema
Add SQL foreign keys to database schema
    execute 'ALTER TABLE researchers ADD CONSTRAINT fk_researchers_departments FOREIGN KEY ( department_id ) REFERENCES departments( id ) '
    http://wiki.rubyonrails.org/rails/pages/UsingMigrations link to:
        http://www.surfdewey.com/2.html
        http://www.redhillconsulting.com.au/rails_plugins.html#foreign_key_migrations
        http://rubyforge.org/projects/mig-constraints/
Call "delete from sessions where now() - updated_at > 3600" (one hour) or whatever

Do pretty error messages, e.g. on invalid public body name page etc.

404s on all invalid URL parameters
Hook global error message also

Legal/privacy
=============

Check act to see if can use pseudonym for FOI request?
"We will not reveal your email address to anybody" - are there circumstances
 (e.g. somebody messaging creator of a request and it bouncing) where we
 may reasonably do this, and should say it may happen?

Maybe we SHOULD reveal their email to the public body, why not?

Say that we would like response by email (not postal address) in footer

Later
=====

Check these out for ids

(10:32:14) richard: you just need to count the number of rows of text and compare it to the number of rows in the textbox
(10:32:29) richard: then increase the height of the textbox by 1em-ish
(10:32:52) Matthew: their function is called autogrow_textarea() by the way, if you just want to look at it...
 thanks :) I won't do it now as there are more important things, I was just accidentally impressed

Lucene for search (ask Louise for plugin)

Read wiki page lots
http://www.mysociety.org/moin.cgi/FreedomOfInformation
And comments on proposal
http://www.mysociety.org/2006/04/04/freedom-of-information-archive/

Check FOE site lots
http://community.foe.co.uk/tools/right_to_know/request_generator.html

Look at this basic US site
http://www.rcfp.org/foi_letter/generate.php

This is interesting
http://www.liverpool.gov.uk/Council_government_and_democracy/About_your_council/Data_protection_and_FOI/FOI/Suppliers_and_Contractors/index.asp

Add spelling checker as in WTT

For grey hints in input fields
http://pauldowman.com/projects/fieldhints/

Somehow validate all pages with HTML validate

Consider having link to publications scheme type pages for each body:
http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/oswebsite/aboutus/foi/index.html
http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/oswebsite/aboutus/foi/coiindex.html

Maybe prepend letter for them with "this is FOI request blah" boilerplate?
