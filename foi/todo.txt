FOI requests to use to test it
==============================

Please send me all documentation relating to the decision to use results from
the Oxford Economic Forecasting's report "The Economic Contribution of the
Aviation Industry in the UK" in the "Air Transport White Paper Progress Report
 2006"

BAILII - relationship with law courts, robots.txt ?

"Fundamental Savings Review" - Tom's friend


Status of messages stuff
========================

On request received /describe page the formatting of the dialogues asking for
state change is broken now.


Use sent again date when there has been resent?, e.g. for
    http://foi.mysociety.org/request/16
Make date estimate use follow up time etc.

Status inputting:
    cope with "other" case when something is both (e.g. received some AND clarify)
    search for 'classify' and tidy text

Status here is wrong:
    http://foi.mysociety.org/request/11

Show proper due date on, e.g.
    http://foi.mysociety.org/request/4
    http://foi.mysociety.org/request/17
Sort by due date, show categorisation everywhere
Alert somewhere if working days table not up to date

Make sure this page is OK
http://foi.mysociety.org/request/14

Adam's woes:
http://foi.mysociety.org/request/18/response/31
- Renders badly
- No doubt leaks email address via download.bin :(
- We don't have "this is an evil techy weird bounce" as option for state of message

And Tom's woes:
    http://foi.mysociety.org/request/8
Also: Consider removing login links from notifications of new responses

Things waiting clarification need link to help you do it.

Do something at least a bit aggressive when response is late


Add - response was made in private state
or maybe 'response refusing to publish for spurious reasons

Lucene for search - use http://acts-as-solr.rubyforge.org/
Have a look at http://swish-e.org/
Or polish up an acts_as_xapian

Sort the requests by when something last happened to them (this needs thought as to what
sort orders we need)

(10:32:14) richard: you just need to count the number of rows of text and compare it to the number of rows in the textbox
(10:32:29) richard: then increase the height of the textbox by 1em-ish
(10:32:52) Matthew: their function is called autogrow_textarea() by the way, if you just want to look at it...
 thanks :) I won't do it now as there are more important things, I was just accidentally impressed

Way of contacting other users
    "We will not reveal your email address to anybody" - are there circumstances
     (e.g. somebody messaging creator of a request and it bouncing) where we
     may reasonably do this, and should say it may happen?
     -- I think this is fine EXCEPT for the facility to send messages. Do we have
     fake hash addresses two way for each user for the message-to-user sending
     thing? Would make sense.

Properly escape all name_and_email functions
