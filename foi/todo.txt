This is knackered:

Maybe do history of tags?

Update test code

Search and replace text "FOI" and "Freedom of Information" out the way more
 - but put it in the title tag
"public body" --> "public authority"?

hidden_field_tags are all wrong - they store value1 x

Adam's woes:
http://foi.mysociety.org/request/18/response/31
    - No doubt leaks email address via download.bin :(

And Tom's woes:

Also: Consider removing login links from notifications of new responses
      Consider password change code in relation to this

Sort the requests by when something last happened to them (this needs thought as to what
sort orders we need)
Sort by due date

Fix the fastcgi errors
[Mon Jan 21 10:38:45 2008] [error] [client 81.107.40.81] FastCGI: incomplete headers (0 bytes) rec
eived from server "/data/vhost/foi.mysociety.org/docs/dispatch.fcgi"

(10:32:14) richard: you just need to count the number of rows of text and compare it to the number of rows in the textbox
(10:32:29) richard: then increase the height of the textbox by 1em-ish
(10:32:52) Matthew: their function is called autogrow_textarea() by the way, if you just want to look at it...

Way of contacting other users
    "We will not reveal your email address to anybody" - are there circumstances
     (e.g. somebody messaging creator of a request and it bouncing) where we
     may reasonably do this, and should say it may happen?
     -- I think this is fine EXCEPT for the facility to send messages. Do we have
     fake hash addresses two way for each user for the message-to-user sending
     thing? Would make sense.

Properly escape all name_and_email functions
