Store the letter
Give a better login dialog

public_body_id not set in outgoing_message (maybe not needed)
Check validation for saving info request / outgoing message pair works with transactions fine
Tidy up error message text (like "body must be filled in" on info request form)
Add created_at / updated_at to every model that might need it
Make sure that constraints / foreign keys in model are in same order as data in schema
Check have validates_presence_of for every belongs_to
Check using :string rather than :text for definitely limited fields like "status"
Redirect the front page to the new FOI request page
Make it say "dear" as default letter

Write some tests (try it their way, at every level)

Tidying
=======

Rename "file_request" controller to "new" ?
Add SQL foreign keys to database schema
Call "delete from sessions where now() - updated_at > 3600" (one hour) or whatever
