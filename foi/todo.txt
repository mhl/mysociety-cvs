Send confirmation email

Make it say "dear" as default letter

Shitty using sessions for redirect back - you lose if you click login
   link elsewhere in same browser, and then do sign in on original.
   It trashes your whole request.

Use something other than session for post redirect store, so can go via email
If you recently made a request, then a login will try to make it again because
    all the stuff for the post redirect is in the session. Consider again

Write some tests (try it their way, at every level)

Tidying
=======

Links to user pages with <sup> etc. in don't work
Check that when on such a page <title> etc. is right

Prevent double posting of same request

If summary is blank, says "title must be filled in" grrrr
Tidy up error message text (like "body must be filled in") on info request form

Set "null" and "default" options more in schema
Add SQL foreign keys to database schema
    execute 'ALTER TABLE researchers ADD CONSTRAINT fk_researchers_departments FOREIGN KEY ( department_id ) REFERENCES departments( id ) '

Call "delete from sessions where now() - updated_at > 3600" (one hour) or whatever

Do pretty error messages, e.g. on invalid public body name page etc.

Legal/privacy
=============

Check act to see if can use pseudonym for FOI request?
"We will not reveal your email address to anybody" - are there circumstances
 (e.g. somebody messaging creator of a request and it bouncing) where we
 may reasonably do this, and should say it may happen?

Maybe we SHOULD reveal their email to the public body, why not?


Later
=====

Add postal address at City University to request

Read wiki page lots
http://www.mysociety.org/moin.cgi/FreedomOfInformation
And comments on proposal
http://www.mysociety.org/2006/04/04/freedom-of-information-archive/

Check FOE site lots
http://community.foe.co.uk/tools/right_to_know/request_generator.html

Look at this basic US site
http://www.rcfp.org/foi_letter/generate.php

Add spelling checker as in WTT

For grey hints in input fields
http://pauldowman.com/projects/fieldhints/

Somehow validate all pages with HTML validate

Consider having link to publications scheme type pages for each body:
http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/oswebsite/aboutus/foi/index.html
http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/oswebsite/aboutus/foi/coiindex.html

Maybe prepend letter for them with "this is FOI request blah" boilerplate?
