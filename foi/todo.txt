Try making login just go username/password always
Ghost out password field when radio not selected on signin.rhtml
Use something other than session for post redirect store, so can go via email
Show that you are logged in in top right corner

Send confirmation email

Redirect the front page to the new FOI request page
Make it say "dear" as default letter

Write some tests (try it their way, at every level)

Tidying
=======

Prevent double posting of same request

If summary is blank, says "title must be filled in" grrrr
Tidy up error message text (like "body must be filled in") on info request form

Set "null" and "default" options more in schema
Add SQL foreign keys to database schema
    execute 'ALTER TABLE researchers ADD CONSTRAINT fk_researchers_departments FOREIGN KEY ( department_id ) REFERENCES departments( id ) '

Call "delete from sessions where now() - updated_at > 3600" (one hour) or whatever

Legal/privacy
=============

Check act to see if can use pseudonym for FOI request?
"We will not reveal your email address to anybody" - are there circumstances
 (e.g. somebody messaging creator of a request and it bouncing) where we
 may reasonably do this, and should say it may happen?

Maybe we SHOULD reveal their email to the public body, why not?


Later
=====

Read wiki page lots
