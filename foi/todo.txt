FOI requests to use to test it
==============================

Please send me all documentation relating to the decision to use results from
the Oxford Economic Forecasting's report "The Economic Contribution of the
Aviation Industry in the UK" in the "Air Transport White Paper Progress Report
 2006"

BAILII - relationship with law courts, robots.txt ?

"Fundamental Savings Review" - Tom's friend


Status of messages stuff
========================

Find transport/defence or rename them on front page

Alert if working days table not up to date

Adam's woes:
http://foi.mysociety.org/request/18/response/31
    - No doubt leaks email address via download.bin :(

And Tom's woes:
    http://foi.mysociety.org/request/8
Also: Consider removing login links from notifications of new responses

Go through all requests and check status is shiny

Next
====

Late followup alerts are only sent first time message goes into that state :(

Spacing on 
    http://localhost:3000/request/113/response#show_response_followup
is screwy

Browse all public bodies from front page
Make front page somehow a bit prettier
Remove the juicier sidebar on request pages

Sort the requests by when something last happened to them (this needs thought as to what
sort orders we need)
Sort by due date

Fix the fastcgi errors
[Mon Jan 21 10:38:45 2008] [error] [client 81.107.40.81] FastCGI: incomplete headers (0 bytes) rec
eived from server "/data/vhost/foi.mysociety.org/docs/dispatch.fcgi"

Later
=====

Get deploying of Lucene search working

Contact form doesn't get IP on live site

Consider on staging sites making follow ups go to dummy address also

Make the email address for responses 
    - something bland for domain name
    - perhaps put name of user in the part before the @ ?

(10:32:14) richard: you just need to count the number of rows of text and compare it to the number of rows in the textbox
(10:32:29) richard: then increase the height of the textbox by 1em-ish
(10:32:52) Matthew: their function is called autogrow_textarea() by the way, if you just want to look at it...
 thanks :) I won't do it now as there are more important things, I was just accidentally impressed

Way of contacting other users
    "We will not reveal your email address to anybody" - are there circumstances
     (e.g. somebody messaging creator of a request and it bouncing) where we
     may reasonably do this, and should say it may happen?
     -- I think this is fine EXCEPT for the facility to send messages. Do we have
     fake hash addresses two way for each user for the message-to-user sending
     thing? Would make sense.

Properly escape all name_and_email functions

Sources of public bodies
========================

Got list of departments from:
http://www.number10.gov.uk/output/Page30.asp

Compare against
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Departments_of_the_United_Kingdom_Government

Skipped: Office of the Leader of the House of Commons

Tricky:
    * Ministry of Defence
        maybe use public@ministers.mod.uk from http://www.number-10.gov.uk/output/Page934.asp and FOE
    * Department for Transport
        just use FAX9643@dft.gsi.gov.uk from http://www.dft.gov.uk/contact ?
Also DfT :( http://www.dft.gov.uk/foi/whatyouneedtoknow/foionlinefrm

Ones that require form:
    Met :( http://www.met.police.uk/information/metric/index.htm
Perhaps just do them manually?

MoJ and NOMS should link to each other?

Schools list: www.edubase.gov.uk

Heather has some for central departments

FOE site has email addresses of lots of bodies, e.g.
http://community.foe.co.uk/app/tc
