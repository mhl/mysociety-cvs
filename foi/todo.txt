Gah - test to see if it queries solr when new message arrives

Search for successful requests now has bogus date order :( Doesn't fit in
    with paradigm of request / incoming message being separate objects.
Perhaps we should be indexing events
    or maybe index success/failure by type known for message?

Search by tags on public bodies

Check cron jobs are running

FOI requests to use to test it
==============================

Please send me all documentation relating to the decision to use results from
the Oxford Economic Forecasting's report "The Economic Contribution of the
Aviation Industry in the UK" in the "Air Transport White Paper Progress Report
 2006"

BAILII - relationship with law courts, robots.txt ?

"Fundamental Savings Review" - Tom's friend

Page of new responses - so I don't have to go into email

Need something to mark contact as bad, e.g. for university of huddersfield

This is knackered:
http://foi.mysociety.org/request/14/response/44/attach/3/Marie's%20letter.tif

Maybe do history of tags?

Update test code

Search and replace text "FOI" and "Freedom of Information" out the way more
 - but put it in the title tag
"public body" --> "public authority"?

download.bin knackered in this one
http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/contracts_or_options_with_kimber

Adam's woes:
http://foi.mysociety.org/request/18/response/31
    - No doubt leaks email address via download.bin :(

And Tom's woes:
    http://foi.mysociety.org/request/8
Also: Consider removing login links from notifications of new responses
      Consider password change code in relation to this

Sort the requests by when something last happened to them (this needs thought as to what
sort orders we need)
Sort by due date

Send email to remind people to classify
Send email to tell admins something isn't classified
Send email to remind people to clarify

Now of course when ids go into requests/users for new ones it just adds an _ on end which is crap!

Later

Preview when sending followups - especially people need to see quoting/subject
when sending "my response is late"

Holding pen with comments - new requests don't get sent straight away, but are
    delayed while people help improve them.

One of the PDFs on live site has:
Error: PDF version 1.6 -- xpdf supports version 1.5 (continuing anyway)
Need to upgrade to poppler-utils?

Add lots more UNIQUE indices

Merge workflow into one stream - find information, if you can't find it then request it.
    so just search is on front page, with popular stuff below a la Google Directory

in sidebar of request 
    Link to WriteToThem - according to level of Government of body
    Start a petition about this request
    Share this request on Facebook

Successful requests should have success date as date in search results.

Tell application developer if working days table not up to date, and needs
updating

Response overdue alerts are only sent first time a request goes into that state :(

Get deploying of Lucene search working

Consider on staging sites making follow ups go to dummy address also

(10:32:14) richard: you just need to count the number of rows of text and compare it to the number of rows in the textbox
(10:32:29) richard: then increase the height of the textbox by 1em-ish
(10:32:52) Matthew: their function is called autogrow_textarea() by the way, if you just want to look at it...
 thanks :) I won't do it now as there are more important things, I was just accidentally impressed
