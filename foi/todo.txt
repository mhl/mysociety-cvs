====

Make response messages go to a mailbox as backup
Make it so if the pipe fails, exim tries again rather than sending an error to the public body.
    Or so errors go to an admin somehow, at the very least.

Track bounce messages via a separate address
    - just record if they are bounce, and any DSN, for now
    - and say in display "automatic message"

Either rotate log files, or merge with Apache ones

Let requester send follow-ups - but to which email address???!! aargh
Do something after 20 working days if you get no response
    display the working days correctly

Work out how to get it to tell you code coverage of .rhtml files
Make it validate the HTML
    maybe with http://www.anodyne.ca/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/be_valid_xhtml.rb
Test that it is actually sending the request outgoing mail, by using deliveries

Remove "Outgoing messages is invalid" error

Make it so "mysociety test" can be done on the servers, so it checks any packages are installed

When you classify something, it prints the error message on the page after it for no reason
 
Add fixtures for info_request_event

Tidying
=======

Do we need to say to the public body "all responses will be published" from a
privacy point of view?

accept-charset="utf-8" on all forms - does it matter if Content-Type of whole
page is already UTF-8?

Use working days

Bubbles don't validate
http://localhost:3000/request/5

Add SQL database indexes to token / email_token in post_redirects

Prevent double posting of same request

If summary is blank, says "title must be filled in" grrrr
Tidy up error message text (like "body must be filled in") on info request form

Set "null" and "default" options more in schema
Add SQL foreign keys to database schema
    execute 'ALTER TABLE researchers ADD CONSTRAINT fk_researchers_departments FOREIGN KEY ( department_id ) REFERENCES departments( id ) '

        http://rubyforge.org/projects/mig-constraints/
Call "delete from sessions where now() - updated_at > 3600" (one hour) or whatever

Do pretty error messages, e.g. on invalid public body name page etc.

404s on all invalid URL parameters
Hook global error message also

Legal/privacy
=============

Check act to see if can use pseudonym for FOI request?
"We will not reveal your email address to anybody" - are there circumstances
 (e.g. somebody messaging creator of a request and it bouncing) where we
 may reasonably do this, and should say it may happen?

Maybe we SHOULD reveal their email to the public body, why not?

Say that we would like response by email (not postal address) in footer

Later
=====

Show public body email address on their public page, with a link to say "this isn't right!"

Screen scrape it and add it to the public body page

(10:32:14) richard: you just need to count the number of rows of text and compare it to the number of rows in the textbox
(10:32:29) richard: then increase the height of the textbox by 1em-ish
(10:32:52) Matthew: their function is called autogrow_textarea() by the way, if you just want to look at it...
 thanks :) I won't do it now as there are more important things, I was just accidentally impressed
