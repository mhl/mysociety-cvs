Give a better login dialog

Tidy up error message text (like "body must be filled in") on info request form
Check using :string rather than :text for definitely limited fields like "status"
IF just title is blank says "Info request must be filled in"

Redirect the front page to the new FOI request page
Make it say "dear" as default letter

Write some tests (try it their way, at every level)

Tidying
=======

Rename "file_request" controller to "new" ?
Set "null" and "default" options more in schema
Add SQL foreign keys to database schema
    execute 'ALTER TABLE researchers ADD CONSTRAINT fk_researchers_departments FOREIGN KEY ( department_id ) REFERENCES departments( id ) '

Call "delete from sessions where now() - updated_at > 3600" (one hour) or whatever

Later
=====

Add spelling checker as in WTT
