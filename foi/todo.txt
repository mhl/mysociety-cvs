Set From: to have name of user, and set To: to have name of body etc. for all mails

Followups:
    - link to the follow up form, or embed in bottom of main request page
    - don't show classify link on /response/ page
    - add spec test code for followups
    - rename get_quoted_part_of_followup
Alert somewhere if working days table not up to date

Test it works if exim is down - e.g. not accepting connections

Remove security warning from admin pages

Make response messages go to a mailbox as backup
Make it so if the pipe fails, exim tries again rather than sending an error to the public body.
    Or so errors go to an admin somehow, at the very least.

Work out how to get it to tell you code coverage of .rhtml files
Make it validate the HTML
    maybe with http://www.anodyne.ca/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/be_valid_xhtml.rb
Test that it is actually sending the request outgoing mail, by using deliveries
Add fixtures for info_request_event
Test sending a message to bounce/envelope-from address

Show due date on, e.g.
    http://foi.mysociety.org/request/4
Sort by due date, show categorisation everywhere



Tidying
=======

Add display of users to admin interface (so can find their email address out)
Link internally between different bits of admin interface

Use working days

Bubbles don't validate
http://localhost:3000/request/5

Add SQL database indexes to token / email_token in post_redirects

Set "null" and "default" options more in schema
Add SQL foreign keys to database schema
    execute 'ALTER TABLE researchers ADD CONSTRAINT fk_researchers_departments FOREIGN KEY ( department_id ) REFERENCES departments( id ) '

        http://www.redhillconsulting.com.au/rails_plugins.html#foreign_key_migrations
        http://rubyforge.org/projects/mig-constraints/
Call "delete from sessions where now() - updated_at > 3600" (one hour) or whatever

Do pretty error messages, e.g. on invalid public body name page etc.

404s on all invalid URL parameters
Hook global error message also

Check log rotation is working well

Legal/privacy
=============

Check act to see if can use pseudonym for FOI request?
"We will not reveal your email address to anybody" - are there circumstances
 (e.g. somebody messaging creator of a request and it bouncing) where we
 may reasonably do this, and should say it may happen?

Later

Synthesise these tips into 4 snappy bullet points

Change to Rails 2, may as well do it now rather than later.

Show public body email address on their public page, with a link to say "this isn't right!"

Screen scrape this and add link to it on the public body page

(10:32:14) richard: you just need to count the number of rows of text and compare it to the number of rows in the textbox
(10:32:29) richard: then increase the height of the textbox by 1em-ish
(10:32:52) Matthew: their function is called autogrow_textarea() by the way, if you just want to look at it...
 thanks :) I won't do it now as there are more important things, I was just accidentally impressed

Lucene for search (ask Louise for plugin)
Have a look at http://swish-e.org/

Read wiki page lots
http://www.mysociety.org/moin.cgi/FreedomOfInformation
And comments on proposal
http://www.mysociety.org/2006/04/04/freedom-of-information-archive/

Check FOE site lots
http://community.foe.co.uk/tools/right_to_know/request_generator.html
It has email addresses of lots of bodies, e.g.
http://community.foe.co.uk/app/tc

Look at this basic US site
http://www.rcfp.org/foi_letter/generate.php

This is interesting
http://www.liverpool.gov.uk/Council_government_and_democracy/About_your_council/Data_protection_and_FOI/FOI/Suppliers_and_Contractors/index.asp

Add spelling checker as in WTT

For grey hints in input fields
http://pauldowman.com/projects/fieldhints/

Somehow validate all pages with HTML validate

Consider having link to publications scheme type pages for each body:
http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/oswebsite/aboutus/foi/index.html
http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/oswebsite/aboutus/foi/coiindex.html

Maybe prepend letter for them with "this is FOI request blah" boilerplate?
