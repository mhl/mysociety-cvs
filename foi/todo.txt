Also: Consider removing login links from notifications of new responses
      Consider password change code in relation to this

Sort the requests by when something last happened to them (this needs thought as to what
sort orders we need)
Sort by due date

Fix the fastcgi errors
[Mon Jan 21 10:38:45 2008] [error] [client 81.107.40.81] FastCGI: incomplete headers (0 bytes) rec

(10:32:29) richard: then increase the height of the textbox by 1em-ish
(10:32:52) Matthew: their function is called autogrow_textarea() by the way, if you just want to look at it...

Way of contacting other users
    "We will not reveal your email address to anybody" - are there circumstances
     (e.g. somebody messaging creator of a request and it bouncing) where we
     may reasonably do this, and should say it may happen?
     -- I think this is fine EXCEPT for the facility to send messages. Do we have
     fake hash addresses two way for each user for the message-to-user sending
     thing? Would make sense.

Properly escape all name_and_email functions

Tricky:

        maybe use public@ministers.mod.uk from http://www.number-10.gov.uk/output/Page934.asp and FOE
    * Department for Transport
        just use FAX9643@dft.gsi.gov.uk from http://www.dft.gov.uk/contact ?
Also DfT :( http://www.dft.gov.uk/foi/whatyouneedtoknow/foionlinefrm

Ones that require form:
    Met :( http://www.met.police.uk/information/metric/index.htm
Perhaps just do them manually?

MoJ and NOMS should link to each other?

Schools list: www.edubase.gov.uk

Heather has some for central departments

FOE site has email addresses of lots of bodies, e.g.
http://community.foe.co.uk/app/tc
