FOI requests to use to test it
==============================

The Better Regulation Executive has issued step–by–step guidance for officials
wishing to use the order–making powers to deliver regulatory reform. For this
and contact details for the guidance, please visit the Better Regulation Unit
Intranet site [NB:This site is only available for Government departments].
http://bre.berr.gov.uk/regulation/reform/bill/index.asp

Please send me all documentation relating to the decision to use results from
the Oxford Economic Forecasting's report "The Economic Contribution of the
Aviation Industry in the UK" in the "Air Transport White Paper Progress Report
 2006"

BAILII - relationship with law courts, robots.txt ?

"Fundamental Savings Review" - Tom's friend


Status of messages stuff
========================

Add - response was made in private state
or maybe 'response refusing to publish for spurious reasons

Use sent again date when there has been resent?, e.g. for
    http://foi.mysociety.org/request/16
Make date estimate use follow up time etc.

Status inputting:
    cope with "other" case when something is both (e.g. received some AND clarify)
    search for 'classify' and tidy text


Show due date on, e.g.
    http://foi.mysociety.org/request/4
Sort by due date, show categorisation everywhere
Alert somewhere if working days table not up to date

Sort the requests by when something last happened to them (this needs thought as to what
sort orders we need)

Make sure this page is OK

Adam's woes:
http://foi.mysociety.org/request/18/response/31
- Renders badly
- No doubt leaks email address via download.bin :(
- We don't have "this is an evil techy weird bounce" as option for state of message
And Tom's
    http://foi.mysociety.org/request/8
And me
    http://foi.mysociety.org/request/17
    - why duplicate?
    - add reply-to header to emails
Consider removing login links from notifications of new responses

Tidying
=======

Add SQL foreign keys to database schema (THIS IS IMPORTANT, or things will screw up)
    execute 'ALTER TABLE researchers ADD CONSTRAINT fk_researchers_departments FOREIGN KEY ( department_id ) REFERENCES departments( id ) '

Mark some requests as test requests


Later
=====

Check act to see if can use pseudonym for FOI request?

Make it so if the pipe fails, exim tries again rather than sending an error to the public body.
    Or so errors go to an admin somehow, at the very least.

(10:32:14) richard: you just need to count the number of rows of text and compare it to the number of rows in the textbox
(10:32:29) richard: then increase the height of the textbox by 1em-ish
(10:32:52) Matthew: their function is called autogrow_textarea() by the way, if you just want to look at it...
 thanks :) I won't do it now as there are more important things, I was just accidentally impressed

Read wiki page lots
http://www.mysociety.org/moin.cgi/FreedomOfInformation
And comments on proposal

Check FOE site lots
http://community.foe.co.uk/tools/right_to_know/request_generator.html

Look at this basic US site
http://www.rcfp.org/foi_letter/generate.php

This is interesting

Add spelling checker as in WTT

Somehow validate all pages with HTML validate

Consider having link to publications scheme type pages for each body:
http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/oswebsite/aboutus/foi/index.html
http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/oswebsite/aboutus/foi/coiindex.html

Maybe prepend letter for them with "this is FOI request blah" boilerplate?

Forgotten password link

Way of contacting other users
    "We will not reveal your email address to anybody" - are there circumstances
     (e.g. somebody messaging creator of a request and it bouncing) where we
     may reasonably do this, and should say it may happen?
     -- I think this is fine EXCEPT for the facility to send messages. Do we have
     fake hash addresses two way for each user for the message-to-user sending
     thing? Would make sense.

Properly escape all name_and_email functions

Give hotline to call body for extra help
Advice and assistance in making FoI requests to the House of Lords is available

Lords. London SW1A 0PW. Telephone 020 7219 0100. E-mail: foilords@parliament.uk
http://www.parliament.uk/parliamentary_publications_and_archives/freedom_of_information_in_the_house_of_lords/lords__foi___how_to_obtain_information.cfm

Including 'Request for information' in the subject line of your e-mail will assist us in prioritising your request.
http://www.parliament.uk/parliamentary_publications_and_archives/freedom_of_information_in_the_house_of_lords/lords__foi___how_to_obtain_information.cfm

Consider putting the requesting user's name in the request's magic email address

Escape "www.liverpool.gov.uk <http://www.liverpool.gov.uk>" properly - so it doesn't catch
the last > converted to &gt; too badly
    http://localhost:3000/request/5?
(and be sure if you use a hack with a secret, it really is secret to stop people making evil links)

Check log rotation is working well

Ask what they learnt from request, and other things?
    and reward by putting their request on front page
