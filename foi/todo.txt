Tidying
=======

Add indices to token / email_token in post_redirects

Prevent double posting of same request

If summary is blank, says "title must be filled in" grrrr
Tidy up error message text (like "body must be filled in") on info request form

Set "null" and "default" options more in schema
Add SQL foreign keys to database schema
    execute 'ALTER TABLE researchers ADD CONSTRAINT fk_researchers_departments FOREIGN KEY ( department_id ) REFERENCES departments( id ) '
    http://wiki.rubyonrails.org/rails/pages/UsingMigrations link to:
        http://www.surfdewey.com/2.html
        http://www.redhillconsulting.com.au/rails_plugins.html#foreign_key_migrations
        http://rubyforge.org/projects/mig-constraints/
Call "delete from sessions where now() - updated_at > 3600" (one hour) or whatever

Do pretty error messages, e.g. on invalid public body name page etc.

404s on all invalid URL parameters
Hook global error message also

Legal/privacy
=============

Check act to see if can use pseudonym for FOI request?
"We will not reveal your email address to anybody" - are there circumstances
 (e.g. somebody messaging creator of a request and it bouncing) where we
 may reasonably do this, and should say it may happen?

Maybe we SHOULD reveal their email to the public body, why not?


Later

(10:32:14) richard: you just need to count the number of rows of text and compare it to the number of rows in the textbox
(10:32:29) richard: then increase the height of the textbox by 1em-ish
(10:32:52) Matthew: their function is called autogrow_textarea() by the way, if you just want to look at it...
 thanks :) I won't do it now as there are more important things, I was just accidentally impressed
