Give a better login dialog

Set "null" and "default" options more in schema
Tidy up error message text (like "body must be filled in") on info request form
Make sure that constraints / foreign keys in model are in same order as data in schema
Check have validates_presence_of for every belongs_to
Check using :string rather than :text for definitely limited fields like "status"
IF just title is blank says "Info request must be filled in"

Redirect the front page to the new FOI request page
Make it say "dear" as default letter

Write some tests (try it their way, at every level)

Tidying
=======

Rename "file_request" controller to "new" ?
Add SQL foreign keys to database schema
    execute 'ALTER TABLE researchers ADD CONSTRAINT fk_researchers_departments FOREIGN KEY ( department_id ) REFERENCES departments( id ) '

Call "delete from sessions where now() - updated_at > 3600" (one hour) or whatever

Later
