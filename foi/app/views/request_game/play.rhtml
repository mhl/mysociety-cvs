<h2>Play the request categorisation game!</h2>

<p>Some people who've made requests haven't let us know whether they were
successful or not.  We need <strong>your</strong> help &ndash;
choose one of these requests, read it, and let everyone know whether or not the
information has been provided. Everyone'll be exceedingly grateful.</p>

<% for info_request in @requests %>
    <%= render :partial => 'request/request_listing_single', :locals => { :info_request => info_request } %>
<% end %>

<p id="game_buttons">
<%= button_to "I don't like these ones &mdash; give me some more!", play_url %>
<%= button_to "I don't want to do any more tidying now!", stop_url %>
</p>

<p>Thanks for helping - your work will make it easier for everyone to find successful
responses, and maybe even let us make league tables...</p>
