ActionController::Routing::Routes.draw do |map|
    # The priority is based upon order of creation: first created -> highest priority.

    # Sample of regular route:
    # map.connect 'products/:id', :controller => 'catalog', :action => 'view'
    # Keep in mind you can assign values other than :controller and :action
    map.connect "/new/:action", :controller => 'new'
    map.connect "/list/:action", :controller => 'list'
    map.connect "/request/:id", :controller => 'request', :action => 'index'
    map.connect "/user/:name", :controller => 'user', :action => 'index'
    map.connect "/body/:short_name", :controller => 'body', :action => 'show'

    map.connect '/admin/:action', :controller => 'admin', :action => 'index'
    map.connect '/admin/body/:action/:id', :controller => 'admin_public_body'

    map.connect "/:action/:id", :controller => 'index'

    # Sample of named route:
    # map.purchase 'products/:id/purchase', :controller => 'catalog', :action => 'purchase'
    # This route can be invoked with purchase_url(:id => product.id)

    # You can have the root of your site routed by hooking up '' 
    # -- just remember to delete public/index.html.
    # map.connect '', :controller => "welcome"

    # Allow downloading Web Service WSDL as a file with an extension
    # instead of a file named 'wsdl'
    map.connect ':controller/service.wsdl', :action => 'wsdl'

    # Install the default route as the lowest priority.
    # FAI: Turned off for now, as to be honest I don't trust it from a security point of view.
    #map.connect ':controller/:action/:id.:format'
    #map.connect ':controller/:action/:id'
    map.connect '/:controller/:action'
